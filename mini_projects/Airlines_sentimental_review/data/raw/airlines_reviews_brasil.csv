most stressful experience,Andrius Tamasauskas,2019-05-22,Avianca Brasil,Trip Verified,  Rio de Janeiro to Sao Paulo. Had worst and most stressful experience with this airline. Bought tickets back in November 2018. Then a few times received email about changing flight times. Ok I understand it happens. So turning up at the airport looked on the screen and couldn't seen my flight. Went to customer desk and been told my flight is cancelled! Couldn't believe what I heard as didn't receive email or text about cancellation. Been told get a taxi /pay myself as they don't provide transfers/and rush to another airport and my flight is due in next 2 hours. Stuck in traffic and it was so frustrating I gonna make to this flight too as I had bag to check in too. Luckily came to airport 1h before flight. This airline should be bankrupt long time ago as no customer care at all and they just put they problems on your shoulders!,Solo Leisure,May 2019,Rio de Janeiro to Sao Paulo,Economy Class,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,1,no
rejected to check-in,Z Darliev,2019-05-22,Avianca Brasil,Trip Verified,"  Be prepared that you'll be rejected to check-in on the counter without any reasons. They said, that agent had an issue with booking, but it can't be true because couple of months before flight I had a chat with support about buying luggage and they didn't mention any problems with registration. As pointed in other reviews the problems in this airport hard to solve as it doesn't have Wi-Fi and airline staff didn't offer any help. So I was forced to buy new tickets 4 times more expensive than initially.",Solo Leisure,January 2019,Foz do Iguasu to Sao Paolo,Economy Class,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1,no
staff were incompetent,Adam Simmons,,Avianca Brasil,Trip Verified,"  Foz de Iguaçu to Rio de Janeiro. After my experience of this airline, it is unsurprising that it is on the verge of bankruptcy. There was an issue over whether we had paid for hold baggage; the picture suggests that we did but, after detailed investigation, it does look as if we did not. However, the staff were incompetent beyond belief: the so-called manager insisted on some sort of number as part of the evidence that we had paid for bags but the airport had no Wifi and we had problems using 3G/4G data. At no point did anybody suggest that we could pay for the luggage and sort out the problem afterwards, something I would have been happy to do. If I had not taken the initiative in suggesting this, we would have missed our flight. One of this ""manager's"" charmless colleagues had the cheek to castigate us for not being able to speak Portuguese at an international airport check-in! Between us, we speak English, Spanish and French but it was apparently OUR fault that the Brazilian education system is woefully inadequate when it comes to foreign languages. Once on board, 30 minutes after take-off, the trolley finally made an appearance. Unbelievably, on a two hour flight, the choice of food and beverages on offer were zero and still water respectively.",Couple Leisure,April 2019,Foz de Iguaçu to Rio de Janeiro,Economy Class,3.0,5.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1,no
crew was extremely kind,Michel Perrin,,Avianca Brasil,Trip Verified,"  Avianca Brasil is on Chapt11. Due to fly Sao Paulo to Rio de Janeiro on Monday, connecting from ZRH, they cancelled my flight on their website, but not on AMADEUS. However on Sunday, I succeed in proceeding to web check-in. Slightly stressed, I arrived in GRU, where I had to check my luggage for domestic flight. Counter was more than unpleasant. My Gold status was not recognized, luggage was not tagged with priority sticker, neither any info given about lounge. I was bothering. On the opposite flight crew was extremely kind. Everything went smoothly and on-time. I discovered later that employees wages have not been paid.",Solo Leisure,April 2019,Sao Paulo to Rio de Janeiro,Economy Class,3.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,3.0,8,yes
price was extremely high,Michel Perrin,,Avianca Brasil,Trip Verified,"  Rio de Janeiro to Salvador. At checkin, my Star Alliance Gold privileges were fully recognized. Boarding was smooth and departure 30 mn late. Food on board extremely limited, but at least free, and served with smiles ! Brand new and clean aircraft. Unfortunately price (>300 US$ vc 65 Usually) was extremely high as the airline took literally profit of year-end demand.",Solo Leisure,December 2018,Rio de Janeiro to Salvador,Economy Class,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,8,yes
Food was nothing special,T Murber,,Avianca Brasil,Trip Verified,"  Sao Paulo to Lima. Friendly and efficient check in process in Sao Paulo. The lounge they offer on Terminal 2 is unfortunately not really great, they have no own lounge and you use the GOL lounge which is really an underwhelming experience, terrible food, old and dated interior, not very friendly staff. Boarding was efficient, staff on board friendly. Food was nothing special. Great was the views from the aircraft! The aircraft is relatively old and dated, but the seats are ok for a 4-5 hour flight (not fully flat).",Couple Leisure,August 2018,Sao Paulo to Lima,Business Class,4.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,7,no
such a horrible experience,Katie McLeod,,Avianca Brasil,Trip Verified," Curitiba to Los Angeles via Sao Paulo. Avianca Brazil is horrible! On July 31 I flew from Curitiba, Brasil to Los Angeles, USA. Both of my bags were lost for a week, the customer service was useless, I was told that my bag was coming on Alaska Airlines, when I called them they had no record, but were nice enough to look up my bags on their tracking. I learned that my bags were separated but none were on their way to me. 6 days after this ordeal, my bags were supposedly on the way, but when the representative called to confirm my address she left a number that didn't work. I finally got in touch with the customer service who told me to just wait until they called back. When I asked to speak to the manager, they said only if I would speak Spanish. I said no problem, and then they hung up on me. At this point I am not holding out hope that I will get my bags back, much less before my 10 day vacation is over. I have never had such a horrible experience in my life, but after reading the reviews, I am not surprised.",Solo Leisure,July 2018,Curitiba to Los Angeles via Sao Paulo,Economy Class,5.0,3.0,5.0,1.0,3.0,2,no
beware of this airline,Sergio Szerman,,Avianca Brasil,Trip Verified, Bogota to Fortaleza. Beware of this airline. It's not associated in any way to Avianca nor the Star Aliance. I had a flight from Miami to Bogotá before the flight to Fortaleza and Avianca didn't allow me to check my bags all the way to Fortaleza. They told me that Avianca Brazil is an independent company. After arriving to Bogotá I had to pay for the service to watch my bags for some hours at the Bogota Airport. Then I had to re-check my bags. They charged me for the second bag. At the return flight my bag was left at the Bogotá Airport cause I haven't had enough time to get out of immigration and re-check it. Now I have to find a cargo company to bring my bag back to Miami. And I didn't receive my Life miles from Avianca Brazil.,Solo Leisure,June 2018,Bogota to Fortaleza,Economy Class,3.0,4.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,1,no
crew were really friendly,W Graham,,Avianca Brasil,Trip Verified," Rio de Janiero to Curitiba via Sao Paulo. Really good experience, really smooth, in-flight entertainment and free food and drink, the cabin crew were really friendly. This really beats European customer service. the leg room is still the same but just the service outweighs it for me",Couple Leisure,May 2018,Rio de Janiero to Curitiba via Sao Paulo,Economy Class,3.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,1.0,7,yes
been a very bad experience,A Lanoraj,,Avianca Brasil,Trip Verified,"  We flew on 11th November from Iguazzu to Rio de Janeiro with Avianca Brazil where we had the worse experience ever. Initially the flight was delayed by one hour but eventually it turned out to be a flight delay of 8 hours and 10 mins, the initial take off time was 11.30 which then turned out to be 7.40pm. This was made worse by a number of issues at the airport and poor staff customer services: Poor communications and updates, no reason given and no idea of when the next flight. It turns out that the plane for that flight was re-directed to do a different route. Staff either refused to communicate or did not know what was going on - keep saying we were going to leave in an hour or 90 mins and it turned out to be 8 hours. we then waited for the crew to come on a later flight that evening to man a plane that was already there to take us back. Inadequate compensation -lunch only provided but vouchers handed out after 4 hours. This was generally poorly organised with long queues from check in desk rather than a different area- this mean people checking in where queuing with those waiting for their vouchers delaying the whole process. Planning to fly a further 7 flights in January and this has been a very bad experience. Poor boarding procedures on flight at 7.40pm.",Couple Leisure,November 2017,Iguazzu to Rio de Janeiro,Economy Class,3.0,1.0,3.0,5.0,3.0,1,no
horribly unfair policy,S Leane,2017-08-22,Avianca Brasil,,"  Booked 3 tickets in economy class from Rio de Janeiro to Brasilia in late August for myself and my parents. My father has a serious lung and heart problem and due to this was informed by the doctors that he could not fly for the next year.  We sent a medical note from a doctor to confirm this to Avianca, they refused the refund stating they will only give back 5% of the airfare for the 3 tickets. Expedia was the agency we booked through, they would not help us. I spoke to a supervisor who basically regurgitated what the agent stated, no customer service at all. Avianca is a greedy company with no morals and no heart, avoid them at all costs. Expedia has incompetent staff who couldn't care less. I thank God these tickets were less than $400 USD for all of us, otherwise we could have lost out on thousands of dollars due to Avianca's horribly unfair policy.",Family Leisure,August 2017,Rio de Janeiro to Brasilia,Economy Class,1.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,1.0,1,no
actually thanked the crew,Mahesh Shantaram,,Avianca Brasil,,"  Salvador to Sao Paulo. Avianca was one of the airlines we flew during our travels within South America, and it was the best. Staff on the ground and in the air spoke English. The inflight entertainment was great, even though it was a short flight. And the food was simple but the kind that announces its arrival with a delicious aroma. It's one of the few airlines where I've actually thanked the crew on my way out.

brand new aircraft,Michel Perrin,,Avianca Brasil,," Salvador to Rio De Janeiro with Avianca Brazil. Priority check-in and boarding for Gold members was perfect. Unfortunately no lounge in Salvador.

best domestic airline in Brazil,Savi Mull,,Avianca Brasil,,"  
Flew Avianca Brazil from Congohas to Santos Dumont. Definitely the best domestic airline in Brazil. Efficient and smooth check-in and boarding procedures with a gate change.

Highly recommended as the top choice in Brazil.",Business,November 2016,CGH to SDU,Economy Class,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,9,yes
expected much better service,L Casinere,2025-10-27,LATAM Airlines,Trip Verified," I had two flights today with LATAM, traveling in Premium Economy as a Gold member, and I expected much better service.  On my first flight (Montería → Bogotá), there was no boarding priority. Passengers from rows 15–20 boarded before us, and we were left standing on the tarmac under the sun waiting to board.  On that same flight, there was no ice available for drinks. The power outlets didn’t work, and when I got to Bogotá, I realized that the terminal at El Dorado only has about 8 outlets for all passengers — impossible to find one . On my connection (Bogotá → Cali), the outlets didn’t work again. I told the cabin manager, but he didn’t seem interested. After all this, I can’t help but feel disappointed. I usually choose LATAM and expect a certain standard, especially as a Gold member, but today’s experience didn’t reflect that at all.",Solo Leisure,October 2025,Cali to Monteria via Bogota,Premium Economy,3.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,2,no

canceled a flight two hours early,G Molden,,LATAM Airlines,Trip Verified,"   If possible, avoid this airline, which canceled a flight on 27 September two hours early, leaving our daughter stranded, and then refused to take responsibility for the considerable cost of relocating connecting flights. They offered a lunch voucher and a local taxi, which was of no use. Simple advice: avoid this company if you have other options. Eviten si es posible este de una aerolínea que canceló un vuelo con dos horas de anticipación, dejando a nuestra hija abandonada y que luego se niega a asumir la responsabilidad del costo de la reubicación de los vuelos de conexión, que fue considerable.

:the flight had already left,C Hallen,2025-09-15,LATAM Airlines,Trip Verified,"   LATAM has repeatedly proven to be unreliable when it comes to getting passengers to their destinations on time. The most recent — and most costly — failure occurred on our trip from Santiago to the Galápagos Islands. LATAM delayed our flight from Santiago to Lima, leaving only 45 minutes to make our connection. We asked for help: at the airport desk in Santiago and again with our flight attendant, explaining that we had no checked bags, were seated in Premium Economy, and could easily make the connection if the gate was notified. Despite these efforts, we arrived at the gate for LATAM 2416 20 minutes before scheduled departure — only to discover the flight had already left. This caused us to miss our next connection to the Galápagos and risk losing our non-refundable $9,000 cruise. Employees told us they were “not empowered” to contact the departing flight or make any effort to hold it — but assured us someone would meet us in Lima and assist. No one did. We were left stranded and on our own to rebook and salvage our trip. Travelers deserve an airline that is reliable, communicates clearly, and takes responsibility when their own delays put customers’ travel plans — and thousands of dollars — at risk. Unfortunately, our experience with LATAM shows that they fall far short of that standard.",Couple Leisure,September 2025,Lima to Guayaquil,Premium Economy,1.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1,no
put on a flight 3h later,A Zukowska,2025-09-14,LATAM Airlines,Trip Verified,"  The flight from Galapagos to Quito has a short stopover in Guayaquil where you dont leave the plane. However my second leg was cancelled and I was stuck in Guayaquil. We were moved to pick bags and left in the middle of the terminal to just join normal queue of people checking in for their flights and maybe we will rebook. No dedicated desk, no support, no information on what is available. Lots of people missed their connections. I was put on a flight 3h later. According to Latam i was entitled to refreshments, I was given nothing. I also need certificate of delay for insurance.",Solo Leisure,August 2025,Guayaquil to Quito,Economy Class,3.0,5.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,1,no
experience was very disappointing,Nickolas Knox,2025-09-05,LATAM Airlines,Trip Verified," I recently flew with LATAM from São Paulo to Lima (LA2429, Aug 15, 2025) in Premium Economy and the experience was very disappointing. Check-in was quick, the lounge in São Paulo was lovely, and the on-board staff were polite and friendly. The Premium Economy product on this flight did not resemble what LATAM advertises. The cabin was old, with torn leather seats and broken seat cover. Breakfast at 8:10 AM consisted of a bread roll with one slice of ham and cheese, plus a small cup of fruit. No choices, no cereal bar, no yogurt, and certainly none of the “hot main dishes” promoted on LATAM’s website. The only difference from economy was that our roll was served on a plate instead of in a paper bag. Later in the flight, when we asked about lunch, we were told there was none — only another roll if we were hungry — even though LATAM clearly states international flights over 3.5 hours should include both breakfast and lunch/dinner. What makes this worse is the inconsistency: just two weeks later we flew a shorter 3-hour LATAM flight from Lima to Santiago and were given menus, a full hot meal beautifully presented, and attentive service throughout. The contrast was stark. Overall, we paid extra for Premium Economy but received virtually no difference in service compared to economy.

“No refund or compensation,Brian Herbert,2025-08-04,LATAM Airlines,Not Verified," Our recent experience with LATAM Airlines on our trip to Peru (July 24 – August 2, 2025) was disastrous.  Both of our connecting flights to and from Cusco were canceled without any notice. No email, no text, no explanation at the gate. We only discovered the cancellations when we arrived at the airport expecting to board. This caused us to miss crucial portions of our itinerary, including prepaid tours and lodging, and left us stranded to find last-minute flights wi 23rdth another airline out of our own pocket.

An awful experience,S Maritis,2025-07-28,LATAM Airlines,Trip Verified,"   A steward had a health problem and an ambulance came to pick him up. They had no replacement possibility so 24 passengers had to stay back. We had a delay of 1h and 50 minutes, nobody spoke English to explain what was happening and we had a connecting flight in Sao Paulo to Rio of 1h 40min. It was obvious that we lost the flight to Rio . We arrived at Sao Paulo at 16.45 snd instead of getting us new seats on the next flight which was at 17.45 they gave us seat for the flight at 20.10 which also had a delay of 20 min.

denied any compensation,Huss Hammoud,,LATAM Airlines,Not Verified,"   Lost my luggage, had a 5 day hiking trip planned in Peru, couldn't deliver my bag on time for my trip, had to buy all new gear, Latam agent said there would be basic compensation and anything above I would need to provide receipts. kept all my receipts then got denied any compensation upon my return, that's one. Before traveling, I tried phoning in to add a suitcase but was told to pay for it at the airport and they wouldn't let me do it in advance. At the airport they billed me $177 U.S for a single 50lb suitcase, which made sense to why they wouldn't do it in advance, so they can demand whatever cost they want and they know you can't refuse, even though their website says $70 for a 50lb suitcase.",Family Leisure,June 2025,Canada to Peru,Economy Class,3.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,3,no
refused to refund us,D Marlenez,2025-07-20,LATAM Airlines,Trip Verified,"   My partner and I bought a flight from Montevideo to Madrid for August 13. This flight was cancelled by the airline, and we were rebooked on another flight the next day. This already created the first problem, as we had a flight from Madrid to Copenhagen on August 14, several hours after the arrival of our original flight with LATAM, which we would miss with the new connection. As a result of the cancellation, we were offered two options: 1. Request a full refund of the ticket; or 2. Rebook to a new flight at no additional cost. As we were advised by an operator through the LATAM's WhatsApp channel, we decided to wait for the possibility of new routes opening up, in order to be able to arrive in Madrid on August 14 and not miss our connection to Copenhagen. After a few days, we contacted LATAM again through its WhatsApp Channel, and we were offered to change the final destination to Copenhagen, since we had missed the connecting flight. However, after the change was made, we were informed that we had to pay a charge of 700 USD per passenger for the change. LATAM refused to refund us the full amount of the tickets as initially offered, thus losing the connecting flight and forcing us to take a flight that we never accepted.",Couple Leisure,July 2025,Montevideo to Madrid,Economy Class,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1,no
had to cancel our trip and fly home,P Keane,2025-07-10,LATAM Airlines,Trip Verified,"   We were going on a once in a life time trip. Latam canceled one of our flights which we know can happen. That was not the complaint. The complaint is they did not help us get on another flight so we could make our connection and there were several other ways to make the flight happen. Our travel agent had told us not to engage with Latam staff and to let our tour guides do everything when it came to Latam which we did until our flight was canceled and we had to engage with them. Our travel agent got us booked on other flights and Latam staff gave our seats to a tour group. We were there without assistance at that time so we did not have someone local pushing to get our seats. Right in front of us the staff talked about how the other passengers were on standby and would have our seats. What the staff didn’t know is that we understood Spanish. In the end, we had to cancel our trip and fly home. Without that connection we could not continue with our trip. The next flight was a week later.

"“rude, unhelpful and demanding”",Mery Abad Ronquillo,2025-05-07,LATAM Airlines,Trip Verified,"   Last April, my family and I booked a flight from Guayaquil to Quito. It was the first time we travelled with Latam and it was the worst experience of our life. I had an ankle sprain and needed to walk wearing a walking boot and a crutch. I applied for special assistant of wheelchair well in advanced. This was authorised but I wasn't told I needed a medical certificate. However, on the day of my flight, on request, I presented a UK medical certificate I had. Although, it included my diagnosis and the medical recommendations (walking slowly and avoid standing for a long time), Latam did a horrendous fuss and cancelled my flight just because it didn't say that I was fit to travel in an airline. According to the information on their website, my medical condition doesn't require a medical certificate! I travelled with another airline on a long trip from London to Guayaquil and didn't have this problem. However, the lady managing Latam staff in Guayaquil's airport didn't follow the airline policies published in their website. She was rude, unhelpful and unreasonably demanding! I had to rearrange my flight. I had to rush to find a doctor in Guayaquil to get a diagnosis and a new medical certificate. This not only left me physically tired and stressed but also brought extra expenses that were not in my plans. Because of this, I had to change my family plans and our day in Quito was ruined. For this reason, I will never again flight with Latam.",Family Leisure,April 2025,Guayaquil  to Quito,Economy Class,5.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,5.0,1,no

really behind the times,R Dalenez,,LATAM Airlines,Trip Verified,"   I booked my flight months in advance and paid for seat assignments. I selected seats at the front of the plane, but during check-in, seats were automatically re-assigned to the back of the plane, last row to be exact. Why pay for seats then?

refund process is frustrating,D Croft,2025-03-19,LATAM Airlines,Trip Verified,"   LATAM Airlines Australia is misleading customers about flight ticket prices. Although I was on their Australian webpage, prices are listed in American dollars. When I called to request a refund, they seemed to anticipate my questions and had excuses ready before I even began asking. The refund process is frustrating; they only initiate it after you reply to their email with personal information that they don’t actually need. This seems unnecessary, but they say it’s in case the credit card refund doesn’t go through. If they followed the proper procedures, the refund could have been back in my credit card account within days.",Family Leisure,February 2025,Sydney to Sao Paulo via Santiago,Economy Class,4.0,5.0,2.0,5.0,1.0,1,no
“Incredibly unhelpful staff”,D Tandy,2025-02-19,LATAM Airlines,Not Verified," I paid £84 for a hold bag online the day before my flight. On arrival at the airport, LATAM said there was an error with their system and the payment wasn't linked to my ticket. I showed them my invoice, receipt email and bank transaction and they agreed the payment had been made, but said I needed to pay £131, and the £84 would be refunded. I made the point that there was no reason for me to pay £50 more because their system had failed, but they wouldn't budge and as I was at risk of missing my flight, I ended up paying. Had a very frustrating experience with their complaints team, who also accepted the issue was with their system, but said system failures happen and that I was liable for the full amount. So essentially, LATAM are rewarded for making a hash of a luggage booking and charging over 50% extra at the airport. Incredibly unhelpful staff at all levels. Scam artists. Enjoy my £131.

there was zero assistance,D Sonn,,LATAM Airlines,Not Verified,"  My travel partner was in a wheelchair which was registered ahead of the flight. We had no problem with American Airline getting there with this issue. We took LATAM on the return trip from IQQ to SCL. They didn't have enough staff so persuaded us to walk to the gate, as they said it was a small airport. The LATAM representative at IQQ said that we were already registered as disabled, that SCL was larger and we would be met there with a wheelchair. There were 3 people disembarking flight 602 in SCL with disabilities and there was zero assistance. For some of the people SCL was their final stop so they were able to wait. We had a short time to make our connection, a wheelchair never arrived and we could not get assistance. We barely made it to the next gate for departure to LAX.

experiences with LATAM went so well,Gary Stoykov,2025-01-16,LATAM Airlines,Trip Verified,"   In a month traveling around South America, I flew Latam Chile 6 times, on the following routes: RT SCL-PMC; OW PUQ-SCL; RT SCL-IPC; and OW SCL-MVD. I may be extremely lucky, but all these flights were on time, safe, very comfortable, and served decent food and drink options. On the 4 flights on which I checked luggage, it arrived within minutes on the carousel. On my last flight to Montevideo, a crewmember approached me and my wife by pronouncing our names in order to serve snacks and drinks to us! I am very happy that my first  experiences with LATAM went so well, and based on these experiences, I can recommend this company without reservations. Thank you very much! One thing they definitely should improve is to provide free wifi to all customers.

the experience was terrible,O Criado,2025-01-14,LATAM Airlines,Trip Verified,"   I flew LATAM (Flight LA8020 from MDZ to GRU) as part of a connecting ticket with Swiss, and the experience was terrible. Although my Swiss ticket clearly included checked baggage, LATAM refused to honor it at MDZ. They claimed the baggage allowance only applied if I were flying directly with Swiss. Despite explaining that on my outbound trip I had no issues (because I boarded with Swiss), LATAM still made me pay an extra fee on the return segment. To make matters worse, LATAM issued only my first boarding pass (MDZ to GRU), insisting they are “not Swiss.” Because of this, I had to exit the terminal in each connecting airport, go through passport control, check in again at the counter, and clear security once more just to get my next boarding pass. It’s astonishing that they sell the entire connection together yet don’t consider baggage allowances, won’t print all boarding passes, and completely ignore any Swiss frequent flyer privileges. Seat selection was another frustration: unless you pay extra, you’re stuck in the middle seat. LATAM’s customer service was unhelpful, dismissive, and showed no willingness to coordinate with Swiss or resolve these issues. If you’re flying on a Swiss ticket that includes segments with LATAM, be prepared for hidden charges, wasted time, and zero accountability.

I have not received a response,Andrew Hall,2025-01-08,LATAM Airlines,Trip Verified,"   Cargo is more important to passengers on a missed connection who were then sent to a hotel 120 km away at 1:30 am I was one of about 15 people flying from Iguassu who missed a connecting flight at 23:30 to London at Sao Paolo airport on 6/11/2024. After queuing at a LATAM desk for about 1 hour at 1:30 am I was given a hotel room in Taubaté, 120 km from the Airport, a journey of 1.5 hours by taxi. I was told that food would be given to me when I arrived. There was no food. I had to book a taxi back to the airport the next day with a voucher. I spent $20 on tips. I had to ask for a voucher for food at the airport. The plane to London the next night was held on the tarmac for at least 1 hour while cargo was loaded. Why could LATAM not have held the plane for an hour the night before to get 15 people on board the flight they were booked on? Why is cargo more important than passengers.

frustration and disappointment,D Molton,2024-12-27,LATAM Airlines,Trip Verified,"   I had luggage checked from Jacksonville Florida all the way to Manaus Brazil. The flights were purchased through Delta operated by LATAM MIA-GRU and GRU-MAO. At GRU baggage claim, I was told by LATAM that Delta had not transferred luggage to LATAM in Miami- but they would send all the way to Manaus and deliver to me on the next possible flight. This was on December 23. Since then, I have not been contacted by LATAM. I have contacted both airlines and understand it is LATAM responsibility. LATAMs lost baggage service tells me every day that my luggage has arrived at airport but cannot tell me when it will be delivered. I have noticed this is a standard message sent every time I inquire. I find this misleading. LATAM refuses to provide contact information for their airport staff in Manaus, who they say are the only ones who actually know the status. Meanwhile, I am in Manaus, without my clothes, sporting equipment, Christmas gifts for family among other inconveniences.

been a horrible experience ,Heidi Zapata,2024-10-14,LATAM Airlines,Not Verified, Today we went to Cusco airport to board a flight to Lima to connect to Juliaca. We came early and were the told that our flight was delayed because of “air traffic” issues— what resulted then was complete chaos. The flight was delayed from 9:40 am to 10:40 am but did not leave till 11:20. On our boarding we were told our boarding passes were invalid. How does an airline give a passenger an invalid boarding pass ? The attendant then proceeded to make changes in the computer to give an updated pass— the computer system was clearly outdated. She kept doing the same thing over and over again — when I asked her what she was doing she responded in a rude and short answer. We finally got our boarding passes the stewardesses there was no room for our carry ons— we found room but then the stewardess took our bag and removed the walking sticks my dad had in the carry on. They took my dad’s walking sticks. We ended up of course missing our connecting flight to juliaca. We were given another flight the next day (they did give a hotel voucher *). However when we asked for our bags— we were made to wait 3.5 hours to get our baggage back. The explanation was that they had to register each bag one by one. The inefficiency of this airline is so apparent ! I asked to speak to a manager several times throughout the process and no one came. While waiting there were cargo boys waiting doing nothing the whole time we were told that they didn’t have staff handy to deal with this. The excuses were endless. “ it’s really far way”. The staff isn’t there. They have to register the bags one by one. “ I decided to call customer service about another flight in a few days to Lima to then catch a flight to the USA. I asked if I could change my flight given the events of today and I was told that I still had to pay 96$ per person. I asked them if they could waive this fee— it should be free! No answer. When I asked about talking to a manager— there was no way of doing this. This has been a horrible experience. We have spent the whole day in the airport without a place to sit or drink a beverage while waiting in Lima airport.

avoid this airline,W Han,2024-10-04,LATAM Airlines,Trip Verified,"   Our Saturday flight from Lima to Peru, they half the plane, stopped boarding, and we sat on the plane for like 30 minutes before we were told to deplane because of tech problem. Ok, sure. We wait another hour in the terminal then they said it's cancelled, rescheduled for tomorrow Sunday.  But here's the actual service problem: Everyone then rushed the desk, and we as business passengers were given no priority at all. My friend and I stood in ""line"" (they didn't bother enforcing any so people just cut in front to talk to the agent) for a while before we tried to get help from another gate agent. None of the other gates' agents could help. We eventually returned to find that they had led the other passengers back to immigration arrivals. We were just told to ""wait"" for another hour with no instructions, and nobody spoke decent English, and every time I tried to communicate in very basic Spanish, I just get shut down and told again to ""wait here"". Between the horrible lack of attention & service and immigration hassle, in total we spent a whole 8 hours at the airport Saturday dealing with this. After going back through immigration into the country, I spoke with the Premium check-in desk, and he could not rebook us on an earlier flight--only the rescheduled one going out Sunday. That agent then gives us a voucher for what was a subpar hotel 45 minutes back in the city. I asked if we can stay across the airport at the close-by hotel or any better hotels, and I was refused. The hotel they gave us was very basic. In fact, for dinner, they served a plate of plain spaghetti with a tiny bit of meat sauce. My friend cannot eat beef or pork, and they had no other options for him. We ended up having to go outside to eat, else we starved. Afterwards, I tried to claim compensation for the lost in time, hotel at destination, and food, and got nothing.

“has all the hallmarks of a scam”,Nicholas Whitlam,2024-04-30,LATAM Airlines,Trip Verified," LATAM is perpetrating something that has all the hallmarks of a scam. Last month, after teaching in Colombia through COVID, our son booked his return to Sydney on LATAM. The party was three: his wife, their one year-old son and he. The route was Bogota to Santiago on one flight and then a second flight Santiago to Sydney. The Santiago to Sydney flight makes a “technical” refuelling stop in Auckland. Strangely, the New Zealand authorities require a transit visa for the Auckland stop. Australians don’t need one. My son’s Colombian wife did. LATAM never told her. Twenty-four hours before their flights were scheduled to leave Bogota, the family sought to check in on-line. They could not check in our daughter-in-law because “there could be outstanding documents”. No details. When, next day, the party sought to check in for the initial Bogota/Santiago flight, LATAM refused to book in our daughter-in-law in as she did not have a transit visa for NZ – which was, after all, on a separate flight. The requirement was news to the family. How long would that take? Perhaps 20 minutes. They figured that if the visa did not come through before the flight to Santiago, it might by the time they reached Santiago. If not, they could stay in Santiago. LATAM refused their request for the family to travel to Santiago - even though no visa of any sort was required for them to do so. These were regular tickets. No discounts involved. The visa for our daughter-in-law did not arrive before the flight to Santiago closed. LATAM documentation shows each member of the family as a “No Show”. This is clearly untrue. Because our son needed to get to Sydney for work, through LATAM they rebooked code-share LATAM/Qantas tickets for flights two days later. The original tickets had cost $5500. LATAM charged an additional $3400, no less. Both the original flights and the rebooked flights had many unfilled seats. LATAM was never going to be out of pocket. This must happen all the time. There may be modest costs involve in re-issuing the tickets – but $3400 extra is ridiculous and usurious. To date LATAM has refused any refund.

she could not accept our dogs,E Kalson,2024-04-27,LATAM Airlines,Trip Verified,"  On April 20 we were supposed to have a flight from Santiago to São Paulo by LATAM, we were three passengers with two small dogs. At the airport check-in counter, the LATAM staff told us that she could not accept our dogs because the dogs in their carriers was a couple of centimeters larger than allowed. Just a few centimeters.  The weight of the dogs including the carriers were 7 kg and 5 kg. And most importantly, after Sao Paulo we immediately had a flight to Istanbul and then from Istanbul to St. Petersburg! So we lost all our tickets. We travel with our dogs and always use the same carriers and we have never ever had any problems! But what’s absolutely crazy is that we flew to Santiago a year ago with these same dogs by LATAM. By the way, during the flight the crew was very strict and didn’t even allow me to bend down, stick my hand into the carrier and just pet the dog. when I told the employee that these dogs had already flown with LATAM in the same carrier a year ago, she told me “well, maybe your dogs have grown over the past year.” I said that my dogs are 8 years old, they haven't grown for a long time, and what she said is incredibly stupid! But she didn't care! So I lost all my tickets and had no choice but to look for another airline company and buy new tickets and spend a lot of money again. LATAM didn’t refund a single cent to me!  We ended up traveling with Sky Airline, Iberia and Turkish Airlines. If my dogs ​​and their carriers were really big, these companies wouldn't accept my dogs, would they? In the end we were on our way for five days instead of two, the dogs and we were exhausted, I spent about 10 thousand euros on tickets for all of us, plus a lot of money on hotels, taxis and so on.

This whole experience with LATAM makes me know I will never come to this country again. First of all, please be very careful flying domestic airlines in Bogota. They will keep changing the gate number last minute and you will have no idea. In certain areas you can’t hear the speakers. I was supposed to be at gate C2 to Cartagena at 12:34 flight. Because they changed the gate, I was there two hours ahead of time, I missed my flight. I asked them at the counter, they told me I had to go back out and speak to a representative.

And the ticketing lady says for a 9 pm flight there are seats but I have to pay another $150. I could get a cheaper flight on another airline and she told me to do this.

Worst customer service ,E Milleau,2024-03-26,LATAM Airlines,Trip Verified,"   Worst customer service of any airline we have flown. 3 of us were booked in business class on a flight from Easter Island (Rapa Nui) to Santiago. The flight ended up delayed by 15 1/2hrs due to a cargo door and engine issue. After an initial delay of 3 1/2 hrs, an announcement was made that the flight was cancelled and all passengers were to go to the check-in to get rebooked. It was utter chaos as we were told every flight for the next 3 days was fully booked and that we were on our own to find accommodation and transportation for an unknown duration on this small isolated island. LATAM refused to be responsible for accommodation because there were ""too many passengers for staff to arrange accommodation with the limited accommodations on the island."" but the passengers were expected to find accommodation on their own?? An announcement was made stating that we would receive compensation for hotel/food for each passenger and the monies would go directly to our LATAM wallet within 24hrs. With virtually no internet, limited cell service, and zero assistance from staff, we were finally able to secure the last 2 rooms in the hotel we had previously stayed in. We were informed by WhatsApp 7 1/2hrs after our original expected departure that a new flight was scheduled for 05:00 the following morning. When we arrived at 02:30 to check in, the airport was empty of staff but dozens of overtired, stressed passengers were already waiting in line. No one in line had received any compensation from LATAM and several were quite upset. We were assured again by staff that the funds would show up in our LATAM wallet and then we could transfer the funds to our bank accounts to cover costs incurred. No funds were ever issued by LATAM. They left hundreds of passengers stranded with no accommodations, no food and no transportation for what turned out to be over 15hr delay for most passengers, with many other passengers delayed for days as this plane was smaller. When we finally boarded and departed, no food was served and towards the end of the flight, business class passengers were going up one by one asking for food only to be given a single yogurt and a juice. When one passenger asked for coffee, they were told they were ""out of coffee"" - how was that possible when no drinks or food had even been served during the flight?? When I reached out to LATAM through several different avenues, I was ignored and finally told that we received a voucher at the airport and so our claim for compensation was denied. We never received anything from LATAM nor the LATAM staff at the Rapa Nui airport. LATAM customer service in Santiago Airport was atrocious. After our Easter Island flight delay, we had missed our rebooked connector and when we tried to get the connector changed, we were accused of being at fault for missing our flight and told we would have to pay for a new flight until I pointed out that the 12 people standing behind us were on the same delayed flight. overall in 6 flight segments we flew with LATAM on this trip, only one was on time and boarding was always chaotic. Five of our six flight segments were premium or business and we rarely felt this was much of an upgrade.

dysfunctional call centre,Y Gan,,LATAM Airlines,Trip Verified,"  LATAM call centre is dysfunctional. The airport ground service is average. The website and app are not easy to use and show you an error message at the end of booking process. Once in the air, they are fine with OK food and polite crew. As a LATAM black member now with call centre priority but it has always been extremely difficult to deal with the call centre. They are not able to assist anything on the phone but to “create a case” for you to get someone else to deal with the request in a dark box. They can select a seat for you but when you check in, the seat won’t be correct. They are not able to make an award booking using my LATAM point. They will only respond to my request following up “case” status after copying the email to their CEO Office. Now it took them 3 months to tell me my request to make an award booking from SDU to CGH in a simple economy class cannot be completed in a required time frame. What’s the use of LATAM pass program?

made my 15-year-old nephew stay at Lima,Michael Johnson,,LATAM Airlines,Not Verified,"  They made my 15-year-old nephew stay at Lima airport by himself. My nephew spent four months in the United States staying with us. He had a form from his parents allowing him to travel however it had expired before he came home. He flew all the way to Lima, and that's when they wouldn't let him board the plane to go to Arequipa with his sister who is an adult. She was able to board, but they wouldn't let him. They said his parents in Arequipa have to get a new form notarized and hand delivered it to Latam in Lima. Wouldn't accept a fax, and they wouldn't let the parents take it to a Latam counter in Arequipa. Essentially they are forcing him to stay at the Lima airport by himself until his parents are either able to fly to Lima to pick him up, or drive to Lima to pick him up. He is 15 years old.

lot of open seats available,Anakin Gomes,2024-03-11,LATAM Airlines,Not Verified,"  I was on a business trip in São Paulo for some work, the flight to São Paulo didn’t let us check-in because they sent us the wrong info, in the Boston logan international airport, there is 5 terminals. A - Delta B - American C - jetBlue E - International Flights. We booked with Delta and they were the ones who sent us the wrong info, they said to go to terminal A, but we meant to go to E and we missed our flight. We flew first class and because of LATAM, we had to pay extra unlike other airlines like Delta, United, and others. but we still got to são paulo. on the flight back, we apparently got overbooked, which we had to wait a whole day for. When we got the seating, it was all scrambled and a minor can’t stay apart from adults.

Completely disjointed and disorganized,M Doyle,,LATAM Airlines,Trip Verified,"  Completely disjointed and disorganized ticketing/reservation system. We called their customer service so many times before our flight to make sure things were set after literally several reschedulings of our flights in the months leading up to our trip and we ultimately chose new flights for our itinerary. This caused so many issues with reticketing in their system that we did not find out about until our return trip. We couldn’t check-in, we couldn’t purchase bags online, and they completely messed up the final connection from LAX to SFO. For whatever reason, none of the flight agents at the check-in counters or customer service could find our LAX-SFO leg in the system even though we have the electronic tickets issued with numbers as well as receipts for the whole itinerary. As a result, they could only check our bags through to LAX and not SFO. We ended up spending over an hour during each layover and connection with check-in assistance or the customer service counter, even though our connections were short. Created a lot of stress around whether our bags would make it at all and if we would even make the next flight because the check-in agents were having trouble. On the final leg with Delta (codeshared with LATAM) I was stopped during boarding because my ticket was reissued sometime during the layover and became invalid. When the gate agent tried to pull my name up, she couldn’t find my ticket anymore. It was absolutely bizarre because my husband’s ticket was scanned with no issue. Took over 20 minutes of waiting and hand wringing and calls by the gate agent to fix the ticketing issue so I could get on the plane. LATAM’s system for handling ticketing is god-awful and the whole triaging process by their customer service is so slow and unhelpful. The Santiago International customer service desk spent most of their time trying to fix their backpack and clicked around looking confused for a solid 45 minutes before saying anything to us about what was happening. She asked us why WE canceled our LAX-SFO flight, which threw us into a panic because we obviously had done nothing of the sort and were desperately trying to get our tickets for the flight printed. We did our best to use Google Translate and speak in our (broken) Spanish but it would’ve been helpful if the agents could communicate at least a BIT in English. After another 20 minutes of silence from the agent clicking around, she finally told us to go to the check-in assistance counter before they closed because our flight was boarding in 30 minutes. Absolutely absurd — no help at all and she should’ve directed us there from the start. Additionally, it seems to be a known issue among the agents and based on customer reviews that the online system for pre purchasing checked bags does NOT work. But they seem to just accept it so you’re forced to pay the premium at the airport rather than honoring the online price. Food was absolutely awful on all the flights and they didn’t even offer snacks during the long-haul, international flights. Delta staff for our Delta connections were fantastic, on the other hand.

Horrible experience,S Davies,2024-02-07,LATAM Airlines,Trip Verified," Horrible experience, when my fiance and I arrived in Lima our luggage stayed in Chicago (where they already sold us a ticket with only 50 minutes transfer) even though we had to go from Terminal 1 to 5, which was two opposites of the Chicago airport. With no warning that this time was not enough to get on time into the airplane. For our luck my fiance could run and arrive there while the gates were closing and tell a lady that his fiancee (me) was coming and could not run any faster as I have asthma. It took only one day to get my luggage to Lima. However, they did not deliver it even though they said they would. So, my fiance and I had to go to the airport where it took around 3 hours to find my luggage as they also lost it inside the airport. When I asked for compensation for the inconvenience plus the costs of clothes and other things, they would only offer me US$94. Even though, that does not even start paying for the inconvenience and the amount of things I had to pay due to not having a luggage.

Between December 27 and 29, I called several times to reserve the space for the pet that would travel in the cabin with me. They told me to first talk to the connection and then call to arrange the space on the Latam flights. After arranging with Delta, Latam tells me that since it is a connecting flight, they cannot add the service on their own flights! They made me waste time, played with the illusion of a 10-year-old boy, were totally insensitive and wanted to make me pay a fortune to change the flight that they themselves want to force me to change!!

I thought nothing of it and got to the airport the next day. My ticket did not include baggage and I was aware that I would have to pay for these separately as was the case on the first leg of my trip. When I got to the ticket counter to pay for the baggage fees i was shocked to find out that the price at the airport was $426 CAD higher than what it would have been if i had been able to check in online. Not only was the price a shock but the customer service representative was rude and antagonistic, smirking every other second as if she was happy to see how much more money we had to pay to take our bags.

"“Bottom line is, flyers beware”",K Gregory,,LATAM Airlines,Trip Verified," Latam Airlines does not have good English speaking staff. Because of that, they are not able to understand what we are saying very well in the US. They also don't have a good online booking process. Here are all my issues with LATAM: 1. I paid for baggage fees in both directions for my flight. The reservation site has a single check for baggage fee. Naturally, I assume that it pays for both directions 2. I called to change my return flight. I specifically asked the agent to confirm that the baggage fees for the return would be transferred to the modified return flight, and the agent confirmed that it is indeed paid for both directions. I think this is probably where the trouble started. My assumptions is that when it is not a round trip, they probably charge extra baggage fee, but they are not clearly calling this out. 3. Everything went fine until I tried to get on my return flight. They told me my return baggage fees is not paid. I had to pay a very high baggage fees, which is nearly double the normal fee if I had paid upfront. Even if the reservation agent had understood me well, and informed me that I had not paid for the second segment when I made the reservation change, I would have taken care of it before getting to the airport. 4. I created a ""case"" on their support site to get this resolved. I explained the entire story and even uploaded the tickets, and the confirmation of the reservation change etc. After one day, I simply got an email from an agent called Alexander Vélez, saying that the baggage was only paid in one direction; and the case was simply closed! I did not even have a chance to discuss this further with an agent, or agree with the decision. 5. I called back to talk to an agent. The first agent I talked to said ""Please wait till I look into the issue"". Then, after 40 minutes of hold, the phone simply went dead!! 6. I called back again and talked to another agent called Angela. Her English was very ""superficial"", and she did not understand what I was saying, and she simply kept repeating the same thing over and over again, without understanding what I was trying to say. Towards the end, I asked her if I could talk to a supervisor or manager, and she said she was not able to transfer me! Bottom line is, flyers beware!

I told her there wasn't any and she said she would try to find one for me, but she never return to say anything and whenever I would try to call the cabin crew, the light would just turn off without anyone coming to see me. It was a 12 hour flight overnight and the aircon was high, I spent all night without a single blanket and when I left the plane I saw that there were at least 3 or 4 kits on top where the bags were in the first seats.

said this document is not valid,Sofia Lopez,2023-12-15,LATAM Airlines,Trip Verified,"  I bought a flight through kiwi from Foz de Iguazu to Warsaw as final destination. On the 10/12 I was at the airport in Foz de Iguazu, and we boarded on time. Around 22.00 I woke up and a couple sitting next to me mentioned we are landing as an emergency in Rio de Janeiro, I was shocked and thought they were joking. And they repeat they have to change due to weather conditions. We are on our way to Rio de Janeiro, from that moment I knew this would be a hell of a journey. We landed in Rio de Janeiro and the crew said they have to change because by law they have completed the time established at work. First thing, passengers don't need to leave the plane because the change of crew is coming, and we will fly back to São Paulo. We waited in the plane for one hour, after that around 23:30 we have to get out and wait without knowing how long we would be waiting. I decided during that time to speak to one of the staff from LATAM, and mentioned I have a flight to London at 23:45, obviously I missed this flight and I will need to know what would happen next. The staff said don't worry, we will wait a few hours here and once we get to São Paulo you should request a new flight to reach your final destination. Around 02:00 AM we boarded again the flight and flew to São Paulo arriving at 03:43 AM, I go to the LATAM office, explained what happened and showed my boarding pass. Staff said you should go to the office on ground floor, they will reissue a new boarding pass for you. The queue of people that missed their flight was incredibly long, I wait in the queue for 3.5hs until the previous staff told me wrong that queue was only for domestic flights. I need to go to a different terminal. At that moment it was already 16hs at the airport. Once again to the LATAM office, and request for the boarding pass to London, they told me they would check with British Airways if they have a seat for me. They confirm I will be able to flight they booked me the new flight and I asked, yes that's okay but I do have another connection missed due to the delay of LATAM. My final destination is Warsaw, not London.  Staff said I will give you a document to request to the other airline to give you a new flight. Another lie from the staff of LATAM. I decided to believe in her word. Waited for my flight until 16:00 Already 24hs at the airport. When I land in London I go straight to LOT office, I showed the document, and they said this document is not valid without boarding pass.

Avoid them like a plague,P Lanakova,,LATAM Airlines,Trip Verified,"  My husband and I were returning to California from our trip to Joao Pessoa, Brazil, with our toddler son. When we approached the gate, the attendant refused to issue us the proper tag for our stroller, stating that we should just place it in our overhead compartment. When we walked up to the airplane door, we were approached by another employee of the airline, who said that we can't bring the stroller with us into the aircraft, and promised to issue an appropriate tag once she took the stroller off our hands. I felt suspicious when she came back with the white tag instead of the pink one. It wasn't until later we realized that she issued a wrong tag and sent our stroller straight to our final destination - San Francisco. When we landed in Sao Paulo for our layover, we were waiting for our stroller to be returned to us at the gate, but it never arrived. The staff was unhelpful, stating that they didn't have it and didn't know where to look for it either. They refused to call anywhere to make inquiries on our behalf. They simply turned their backs to us and walked away. They treated us like we were some sort of nuisance that they wanted out of their space as quickly as possible. We were exhausted, confused, and frustrated. We were forced to rush into the baggage claim with a sleeping toddler in our arms in the middle of the night, and our hands full with our carry-on bags. When we finally reached the baggage conveyor, the attendant stated that we had a wrong tag and our stroller was sent directly to San Francisco. Who in the world sends a motion-assistance device all the way to the final destination?? I purchased the stroller for this airplane trip specifically, so that our toddler son can get some rest in the airport in-between the 4(!) flights that we had to take to return home, but the stroller was just taken away from us by a person who doesn't know how to handle them correctly. This is the same as making a disabled person run around the airport trying to locate their wheelchair and subsequently being told they can't have it until they complete their journey. I was shocked and appalled by how our family was treated by the airline. When we reached the LATAM check-in counter in São Paulo airport, the employee on duty confirmed what we suspected: we have been misled by the airline workers. The employees we spoke to prior to this moment knew exactly what happened to the stroller: the luggage tag is always white, and the stroller gate check tag is always pink. They willingly made us run around the airport while holding a sleeping child, because they didn't want to do the work of correcting the mistake of the gate attendant in Joao Pessoa. I was shocked and appalled by the lack of professionalism that we faced during our journey. This experience left me feeling disrespected as a customer, as well as an individual. The airline made it very clear that they have zero regards for the health and experience of their customers, regardless of their age group. I'm utterly disgusted that my 1.5 years old son was treated in this manner. All my attempts to contact the airline to make things right were fruitless. The customer service representative simply hung up on me when I called. Avoid them like a plague.

Disappointing Premium Economy experience,Sanjay Chadha,,LATAM Airlines,Trip Verified,"  Disappointing Premium Economy experience. I recently flew with Latam Airlines on Flight LA3354 in Premium Economy, and it was an utterly disappointing experience. From the lack of organization during check-in to an unexpected filming activity onboard, the journey fell far short of what one would expect. The unannounced filming not only invaded passengers' privacy but also caused a significant delay in our flight, disregarding our time and schedules. The crew's activities created a distressing atmosphere, and issues with seat functionality added to the discomfort. Moreover, the delay in service due to staff involvement in filming left passengers confused and dissatisfied, with no clear explanation or resolution from the airline. Despite reaching out to Latam Airlines for a resolution, the response has been lacking. It's disheartening when an airline fails to address such grievances promptly and adequately. Overall, my experience was subpar, and I hope Latam Airlines takes these concerns seriously to improve their service quality for future passengers.

very poor quality main meal ,S Calicca,2023-11-10,LATAM Airlines,Trip Verified,"   Fairly old plane for intercontinental flight.  The service during the flight from the flight attendants was very limited.  For 11 hours of flight, a very poor quality main meal and an equally terrible snack.  No drink service during intermissions.  Limited entertainment due to lack of language options in films and TV series.  On both trips my headrest was broken. Aereo per il volo intercontinentale abbastanza vecchio. Il servizio durante il volo da parte degli assistenti di volo era davvero limitato. Per 11 ore di volo, un pasto principale di pessima qualità e uno snack, altrettanto pessimo. Nessun servizio drink negli intermezzi.

how kind and friendly the crew was,G Aldana,2023-10-24,LATAM Airlines,Trip Verified,"  This flight was on an ex VivaAir Colombia A320 with vivaair interior so there was no latam play and the interior of the aircraft was still in viva air’s configuration. After flying in from New York in the morning I spent the day and early afternoon and returned to El Dorado for my flight to Cartagena. Check in at LATAM’s premium counter was a breeze. Upon boarding our lead flight attendant Jessica welcomed every premium economy individually and we all had a water bottle waiting at our seat. Since I switched rows so a guy could be with his kid I went to Row 1 seat A. There was tons of legroom the only bad thing was the window was dirty so I couldn’t really see much. About 20 minutes after take off we were offered beer, water juice and coffee. I opted for a Club Colombia we were also offered chips and a little bar with chocolate. The flight itself was quick. One thing is the seats didn’t recline at all since the aircraft was still in Vivas configuration but it was made up by how kind and friendly the crew was on this flight.",Solo Leisure,October 2023,Bogota to Cartagena,Premium Economy,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,10,yes

Food was reasonably good but far from exciting. The ""champagne"" was below acceptable standards. The other wines were adequate.

It became a nightmare as they did not listed me in the connection flights and had to wait until last minute to board at Chile and then Auckland. My suitcase arrived damaged and I claimed within the 7 business days of my arrival but they did not accept the claim because for their convenience they ended up counting 7 calendar days.

Worse experience ever,Maria Grao,2023-09-24,LATAM Airlines,Not Verified,"  I have been experiencing a hard time buying my check bag, after multiple tries I spoke with a representative on the phone who recommended adding my bag on the airport because on the phone they had additional fees, once I got to the airport each checked bag was $150, literally $67 more. Their customer service was awful. I said I was going to get it online where the rep. told me I was going to lose my flight if I was getting out of line, I was literally 3 1/2 hrs early for my flight. But the harassment was awful, I told them I called and I was given the info about adding the bag, she said she was not able to see so she ignored me giving no other option.

pitiful customer service ,Kurt Kirton,2023-09-13,LATAM Airlines,Trip Verified,"  LATAM was the only airline making a direct flight btwn Miami and Fortaleza, Brazil (for Nov 1 2023). I paid about $125 extra to book this vs. flying MIA all the way down to Sao Paulo then 3.5 hours back up to Fortaleza. Then about 5 months after I bought my airfare looks like they've cancelled this route. I asked for a partial refund, or at least for them to compensate me by letting me choose my seat ahead for no charge, and they denied both requests. The only options they'd allow (and the rep even spoke with his manager as I requested) was to cancel their rebook for a refund or take the rebooked flight through SP.

Although I have Gold status at BA and purchased a first class ticket, their service is zero. Ground staff is an exception, always very attentive. Flight crew doesn’t seem to care whether or not you get on board… they are always talking to one another. Service onboard is almost non existent, worse than low fare airlines in Europe. Why don’t they sell food onboard? Probably because they don’t want to bother. I have flown in Brazil 10 times this year, and it is always an unpleasant experience with LATAM.

LATAM cancelled our flight from Cusco to Lima and reschedule it for Aug-16. Due to which we missed all our other flights. We had to change our itinerary and cancel Iquitos from our trip because of LATAM. Losing all money paid to hotel, flight, prearranged car. Total loss incurred for 4 people was $1800.

just incompetent and awful,H Armstrong,2023-09-06,LATAM Airlines,Not Verified,"  It is less about the fact that weather can cause issues mid-flight, and that cancellations happen sometimes. It is more about the fact that Latam customer services will force you to wait 5 hour to rebook your flight even if you're the first person in line, that their website does not work at all to make a complaint, or that their customer services tells you to book a hotel and that it will be covered by Latam if you file a ticket, since they're forcing you to wait 16 hours for another flight (when most of the rest of your plane was placed on same day flights even though they were behind you in line). Turns out Latam are greedy, dishonest, and incompetent as their online rep and twitter account both disregard your complaint and claim they wont cover the hotel since the flight was turned back due to weather. Here's the thing - that would not have been an issue if it was ever what the Latam agent said even once at the airport. Have had many other issues with them in the past and this is the final straw. They are just incompetent and awful. Fly sky instead, or any other option available.",Solo Leisure,August 2023,Santiago to Calama,Economy Class,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1,no

Over 5 hours in the Santiago airport waiting for them to figure out a flight for us to take, screwing up our airbnb reservations and making us lose a full day of vacation, they failedto organize the SHUTTLE back to the airport the next morning, so we had to figure that out on our own. When the flight was delayed, they didn't give a voucher for food or provide a place to stay in Santiago, and our flight wasn't for another almost 24 hours.",Family Leisure,August 2023,Santiago to Concepcion,Economy Class,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1,no

service is terrible,Javier Santos,2023-08-12,LATAM Airlines,Not Verified,"  If I could rate the service of this company in numbers, I would give it a -10 and no less than zero stars. On August 11 2023 I traveled through LATAM airlines, flight 4402 to connect my connection in Miami on an international flight. My odyssey began when I arrived at the El Dorado airport in Bogota to check in. The number of passengers, the chaos, disorder was like a movie. Very few airport staff do not have the training and even to my surprise almost no one speaks English. Continuing with my checking, it could not be done electronically, so I was redirected to the counters personally. When entering the checking line we had an average of 20 people with only 2 people from customer service. Ask a LATAM employee why you were waiting and if there was no staff for international passengers to attend to them directly. He replied no, that the same waiting line was for national and international passengers. I explained to him that in my opinion it was not right and the ticket costs were different (obviously the international tickets were more expensive) and in the case of connections they were more harmful for me. He told me that he couldn't do anything. My ODYSSEY really started there since when I checked the lady at the counter told me that my luggage had exceeded 20 Kilograms (approximately 40 pounds) and that I had to pay the excess. I answered that the suitcase had already been paid for at the place of origin in the United States and that I did not understand why I had to pay for it again. The lady from LATAM told me that I only had it for 10 pounds and OH my surprise when she told me that I have to pay an extra US$177.00 if I wanted to send it with my flight. I decided not to do it and tried to talk to a supervisor who never showed up and shone by his absence. When checking the prices of the suitcases on the website, costs between US$ 14 and up to US$ 25 appear on domestic flights but nothing is indicated for international flights. No one gave me an answer to what happened, so I filed a complaint on the LATAM website. In addition, the cabin service was of poor quality since there is no empathy or sympathy with the flight employees, low quality food and low communication too. My conclusion, if this review is of any use, do not travel with this airline since its service is terrible, unprofessional and the only thing they want is your money.

We were running out of time and they ask for this ridiculous amount of money $355.49 for two bags about 35 lbs e/a they assured me that if it was already included they will refund the money in Miami but this never happened. Basically, they held us hostage, until the last minute to make us pay. We paid the full amount for the trip to Delta Airlines and the luggage was included both ways we flew in with four bags and came back with only two bags.

Sad experience,Roman Sapia,,LATAM Airlines,Trip Verified," Boarding was a mess, there was no room for those of us who had the correct luggage, and we put small things in the front seat, the compartments were full of other passengers' small things. Why make rules if then they don't enforce them? The food was completely cold, impossible to eat. The flight was delayed by more than 1:30 pm, for a ""medical"" reason. That was the only comment after keeping us on the plane for that time without any explanation. Then in Lima, with a 5:00 p.m. wait for the next flight, they could not explain to us whether or not we should pay the airport tax of more than 30USD per person if we wanted to re-enter the airport after going out to the city to a nearby hotel. The best response we got from the airline was that it was ""random."" Sad experience, unfortunately not the first with this airline, I will do my best to avoid it in the future.

LATAM Airlines Photos,T Laytana,2023-06-14,LATAM Airlines,Trip Verified,"  We flew Latam but on Delta, so the trip itself was not a problem. The real problem is if you need to make any changes to your ticket, you are really doomed. Let me explain why. I had to change the tickets dates for me, my kids and my mother in March 2023. Every time I called it was a different problem. Every single time they encountered a problem in the system. Every time I called (same day) the fare would have a different price, it would vary from 2k to 3k and then $700 on the same day (this is only the fare difference on the ticket I have already purchased). I know the fare changes constantly, but it didnt make sense .. every representative would give me a insane price every time I called. The changing fee would be different on every call.. on one call he said there would be no fee, another one told me it would be $150, and then $300 and $450 .. no consistency. Even when I agreed to pay a lot more for the fare difference the system would not process the payment and I would have to call back later and go through the same process over and over again. Also, my mother was on a different reservation so I had to double the calls because they could not resolve everything in a single call always saying the system was down or payment could not be processed at that time. After several calls the problem was resolved at 2am. Don't get me wrong, the customer service representatives are polite and friendly but they cannot help! Fast forward to June I had to change my mother's reservation again. When I booked her ticket several months ago, I bought a more expensive ticket so we could have flexibility on changes, and it was the same nonsense. Several calls, crazy fare changes and to put the ticket on hold they wanted to charge me $450 + changing fees, + the fare difference whenever I book in the future.. so it was better just not show up for this flight and buy a new ticket with another airline company. I don't usually write reviews, but I wasted so much time and money that Latam was my worst airline experience.",Family Leisure,June 2023,Lima to Cusco,Economy Class,4.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2,no

Still haven’t received the luggage,L Bessell,2023-05-27,LATAM Airlines,Trip Verified,"  After travelling to Peru with 14 paramedics to participate in a charity trek, my luggage arrived 7 days after me. My flight consisted of 3 transfers: London to Madrid, Madrid to Lima, and Lima to Cusco. I knew in advance that I had to collect my luggage in Lima and recheck in. When attempting to collect my luggage in Lima mine was the only one not to arrive. I immediately sought help but was advised to board my flight to Cusco and the gate was about to close and open a claim when I arrive in Cusco. Latam 1st admitted responsibility, then decided that no compensation would be paid as the case was opened in Cusco, not Latam. I explained that was advised to board the plane due to the gate closing but they would not accept this. They are trying to tell me that it is my fault, despite the airline in Latam telling me that they withheld my luggage in Madrid and returned it to London, so it was never available for collection. When my luggage finally arrived 7 days later, the staff at Lima airport were passive-aggressive and called security when I asked how I claim the delay. The gentleman made me feel so uncomfortable as if I has been in the wrong. The lock had been forced open and everything inside the case searched. I have been treated appallingly from start to finish.

Very nice experience,G Aldana,2023-05-17,LATAM Airlines,Trip Verified," This was my first long haul flight on a Latin American carrier. Prior to boarding the plane in Lima everyone’s bag was searched for “contraband” (water bottles or any liquids over 250ml). Once onboard the flight I was welcomed by the crew, made it to my seat which was originally a window, thankfully the guy next to me took up my offer and switched to aisle. Even though the cabin was outdated those seats were extremely comfortable and provide great recline. Each seat had a blanket, pillow and headphones. About hour and a half after take-off there were two options for dinner Asian style chicken and rice or pasta with seeds. As for drinks they had sodas including inka cola as well as beer and wine. Inflight entertainment is pretty good. The only thing that was missing on this flight was in between meals they offer nothing but drinks not even chips. An hour prior to landing we were given breakfast which was a warm ham and cheese sandwich with fruit and drink offerings. Since it was an overnight flight most people slept.

It was a pleasure flying with LATAM,J Horten,2023-04-18,LATAM Airlines,Trip Verified,"  SCL-GRU in business class B-787. This was an onboard service shocker: boarded flight at 345pm for a 430pm departure, had a short 30 minute mechanical delay. I was not approached by any member of the crew to welcome me on board, offer a glass of water, juice or champagne while on the ground and the first contact with the crew was almost three hours after boarding when they served lunch. I've never been on an international business class flight where this had happened. The crew was completely missing in action. I have no idea what they were doing but they did nothing customer facing for three hours - this was a $1000 return ticket? This is the equivalent to going to a very expensive restaurant and prepaying for the meal and having nobody approach your table with any kind of greeting or service for three hours. It's outrageous. I talked to the purser about it before the flight ended and she was unapologetic and had lame excuses such as they can't do anything for 30 minutes while over the Andes which I totally understand but she didn't address the lack of service while on the ground for two hours because there was no defense. The SCL crews are very arrogant and the airline should be ashamed of themselves. I'd also add the 2x2x2 configuration is old school and offers zero privacy from neighbors and unless you're in the center section someone will be crawling over you to get to the aisle or you will be crawling over them. IFE was touch and go the entire flight One highlight worth noting is the SCL lounge is exceptional in every way, best in South America for sure.

crew were extremely nice and courteous,C Panilos,2023-04-04,LATAM Airlines,Trip Verified,"  First off they force masks which isn't bad, but they don't tell you until you get to board. I almost lost my flight trying to find one in Bogota airport and had to pay 20 dollars for the one I got. The app is horrible and I paid for a window seat and didn't get it. As the app didn't save my boarding. Lastly the check in and boarding staff at the gate in Bogota airport are rude. They lost my bag on my arrival flight had to send it with Avianca and i got my clothes a day late and my bag was beaten to hell. No wifi, no video screens and no electric plugs.

an onboard service shocker,G Hallam,2023-03-20,LATAM Airlines,Trip Verified,"  Premium Economy on Latam on some routes seems to replace Business Class. The result is some more legroom, the centre seat (3-seat unit) is unused and bigger, better catering and forward cabin seating. Sometimes the centre seat is just unused, sometimes it becomes a tray. Crew are quite good, authentically friendly and helpful. Catering is ample and simple.

The app is horrible,C Ward,2023-03-15,LATAM Airlines,Trip Verified,"  First time traveling to Chile. To get from Belize used Copa (very poor) and Avianca (horrible-the Spirit Airlines of S. America - you get nothing-not even water-on a 6 hr flight from Bogota to Santiago-they used to be great). Once in Santiago, I took an RT from SCL to Easter Island-6-7 hour flight. Delayed over an hour as it appeared this was the first time they ever had a full flight to Rapa Nui-that was the delay-getting passengers on the plane-an hour late, no connecting flights! The meal? Worst ever by far penne pasta, sauce and a sliver of queso, no meat and flavor. Same meal 4 days later on my return flight. And on my other two flights to Puerto Natales and Calama later on they serve soda out of a room temperature plastic bottle into tiny cups.

extremely impressed with this flight,Facundo Mendoza,2023-03-11,LATAM Airlines,Not Verified, Never make the mistake to fly this airline again. I flew them several times. Making changes with them is a very long process and even flight in the higher class they charge you money. When you want refunds they give you vouchers and it is absolutely impossible to change them or get that money back.

loved every minute of this flight,Rob Leroy,,LATAM Airlines,Not Verified,"  Do not ever use this airline. I am speaking from experience as someone who has traveled to over 60 countries and used at least 80 airlines. Their flights are either delayed or canceled 75% of the time and they won’t hesitate to change your flight from early am to late pm for no reason other than they want to resell your ticket.

authentically friendly and helpful,P Miller,,LATAM Airlines,Trip Verified,"  Flew from LIM to BOG in Premium Economy. There was no one at the Premium checkin, so I was done in seconds. The Sumaq lounge was fine with a good selection of food and drinks. We left on time and arrived early. Cabin was fine, with middle seat blocked out. We were given pillow, blanket and a small amenity kit which I wasn’t expecting. The flight attendant for our cabin introduced himself to each passenger and said to let him know how he could help. Breakfast was served and then I had a couple of beers. I had a question about luggage transfer at BOG and the attendant went out of his way to get me an answer. The BOG to MDE flight was delayed by about an hour but the flight itself is so short that we almost caught up time. For a 29 minute flight, they still served a small sandwich with crisps and a drink. I was impressed with both the service and the punctuality.",Solo Leisure,February 2023,Medellin to Bogota,Premium Economy,2.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,8,yes
attendants were indifferent,Anton Vavilov,2023-02-24,LATAM Airlines,Trip Verified,"  That was supposed to be a short 30 minutes flight trip which turned into seven hours of hell. First of all, to check in our bag at Medellin airport we had to queue for 1.5 hours, as there is a lot of Latam staff at the airport but they are normally too busy to chat with each other. Secondly, after security check completed, just before boarding time, we found out that our flight had been cancelled. All the passengers approached the lady who was registering passengers at another gate for another flight. She helped a few who had connections and asked others to return back to check in area to reschedule the flight. The majority of passengers who did not have the luggage could just reschedule their flights online without leaving the gate area and queuing up again. Yes, this is where another minus one star from the rating is coming. Three ladies who for some reason were standing together at one counter to regulate the queue found a brilliant solution asking all the passengers of the cancelled flight queue to the check in counters again. At some point, I connected to the airport WiFi and helped some passengers to reschedule their flights online without queuing up, so they could go to do their security check again and return to the gates area. The fourth lady (as three others were again busy chatting and laughing in the middle of this chaos) who was walking in the queue was very surprised it was possible to reschedule the flight online. Passengers with the luggage were expected to pick up their bags and re-check in them again. Our problem was they could not find our bag. After a few attempts the check-in representative suggested that it might went to Bogota (how? on cancelled flight?) as they cannot allocate it in Medellin, and he suggested that the bag will fly on the same plane with us, as I re-scheduled the flight online. Another minus one star for professionalism. Full of doubts we boarded the re-scheduled flight. Of course, our bag was not in Bogota upon arrival. Six people working at Latam Luggage Tracking kiosk could not allocate it and after exchanging a few calls with Medellin staff suggested to fill the form and promising our luggage will be delivered to London. This is when my trust in Latam ground staff fell below zero. Again, with mixed feelings of hopeless and doubts we filled the form, staff returned us a copy asking to check the status online. We decided to check the online service immediately and found out there was not a tracking or reference number on the form! The answer was appalling: ""Oh, we have not register your form online yet!"". Really? And how we were supposed to check the status online without tracking number? Another star off. Meanwhile next two Latam flights from Medellin arrived and whilst we were patiently asking the Latam staff to do their job, I turned around and found our bag among others from the next flight. Guess what? Another passenger's luggage tag were attached to our bag! Latam, is it safe? Is it professional? Of course, nobody from Luggage Tracking kiosk could answer how come the other passenger's name tag was on our bag. They just pretended they did not hear that question. The passenger's problem is up to the passenger to solve it. And lack of investment in staff is shocking.",Family Leisure,February 2023,Auckland to Sydney,Economy Class,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1,no
bottom of efficiency,N Merler,2023-02-14,LATAM Airlines,Not Verified,"  My review is not specifically about the flight but the shocking customer service. We bought a ticket with LATAM for a return flight. They lost our bags and took zero ownership of both finding the bags and compensating us for the delay of over 48 hours for us having to replace what we did not have. The bags were eventually found by us and were flown the following day by LATAM, but no one from LATAM or their ground agents did anything to contact passengers to advise. If it weren't for one of the other passengers having an Apple Airtag, we would have never known where our bags had gone. LATAM's so-called customer support tried to hide behind an IATA rule to say it was another carrier's problem as we had been put on another flight when ours was cancelled. This is despite the other airline never getting our bags and LATAM flying our bags to their destination. Do not trust this airline with your bags or stick with any conditions of the ticket agreement or international flying agreements for passengers.",Family Leisure,April 2022,Santiago to Buenos Aires,Economy Class,3.0,5.0,2.0,1.0,5.0,1,no

They lost one of my bags and damaged my other bag, I've been without my things for 3 days now and they have not stayed in proper contact with me and told me on my second day they could not deliver it after 12 and they would deliver it to me on the 3rd day but I still haven’t received any information or my bag. They also won’t take any responsibility for the broken bag, they ripped my zipper right off and now the bag is not usable and I need to replace it with my own money. I also asked to go pick my bag up from the airport myself and they haven’t given me the option to do that even tho the lady that assisted me at the airport said I would be able to.

turned into seven hours of hell,Mike Smith,,LATAM Airlines,Not Verified,"  I did a trip to South America four years ago, and many of my flights were with LATAM. Let me say as someone who has been to 60 countries and flown at least 100 airlines, they are the absolute worst. You can literally book an early morning flight that you have to have, on Tuesday, four weeks before the trip and by Thursday they’ll tell you “sorry, we had to reschedule it to a late night flight”. Really all they are doing is bumping you for somebody that might be using their SkyMiles. They’ve done that to me three out of five trips. The other two flights they were late, so they are batting 0% for efficiency. Again, I am saying they are the worst out of 100 airlines without exaggeration as someone who has traveled to over 60 countries.",Solo Leisure,January 2023,Madrid to Santiago,Economy Class,5.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no
shocking customer service ,J Tee,2023-01-29,LATAM Airlines,Not Verified," Our flight from Sydney to Santiago with LATAM was cancelled due to the Auckland floods. No contingency flight was arranged. There was no communication from LATAM regarding what to do next. Call center staff had no idea what was going on with the floods and what LATAM's response would be (whether or not there would be a contingency and how to proceed). LATAM call staff became argumentative when we asked to speak to someone who knew what was happening in response to the flood cancellations and hung up on us several times. LATAM also refused to provide a full refund, claiming that another airline prevented them from doing so, even though the entire booking was through LATAM. They have essentially stolen from me.

Worst experience I've ever had,Rob Schaverien,2023-01-11,LATAM Airlines,Not Verified,"  The first flight I was served a long life kosher meal that tasted not good so I left it thinking I would eat on my next flight. I boarded my flight at Sao Paulo and dinner was served some time into the flight. It was crammed, I was in row 47, it was claustrophobic everyone was so close to each other. For a very long flight it was not an easy flight in those conditions. The food came as I am lactose intolerant I ordered a kosher meal as milk and meat are not mixed but they forgot to load a meal. The stewardess was apologetic but could not even find me an apple. Any food I had was removed in Chile. I thought I would wait till breakfast of course they could not confirm anything they had did not have lactose, so I ate nothing as again they said they did not even have a bit of fruit to offer me. I did not eat till I got home. 32 hours since breakfast the day I left Santiago. Can’t really recommend such an airline.

they are the absolute worst,Peter de Zeeuw,2022-12-30,LATAM Airlines,Trip Verified," After I got badly hurt during an attempted robbery in Quito, Ecuador, I could no longer proceed to travel to Peru and Bolivia. So I provided LATAM Airlines with the information and evidence they needed and asked for a refund of both tickets. It was incredibly frustrating to communicate with their customer service. It was like 6 different people were handling my case, without communicating with each other. Several times I got send the same emails by different people, asking for information I already gave them. Either they did not understand or did not want to understand me. To be honest, at a certain point, I got the feeling that all this confusion was on purpose, just to discourage me from getting my refunds back (also based on reading reviews from other passengers). You're supposed to be a professional airline. You can't be this incompetent, can you? Eventually, I got a full refund for one ticket, which is good, but I still lost € 545.97. At this point, I'm just too tired to pursue it anymore, so all I can do is warn my fellow traveler. If the flight goes well, be happy. But if problems arise, you have been warned.",Solo Leisure,December 2022,London to Sao Paulo,Economy Class,5.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,4,no
my worst travel customer service,Bridget Walton,2022-12-24,LATAM Airlines,Trip Verified,"  LATAM is unable to provide adequate support when it comes to flight changes or issues which leaves customers to fend for themselves or fork over a ton of cash to fix LATAM's problem. I do not recommend flying with LATAM if you will have multiple connections or if you're booking out far enough in advance that flight times, etc. might change because it will be nearly impossible to get your itinerary corrected. I purchased my flights directly through LATAM from SAN to LAX to SCL. When it came time to check in for my flight (18 hours before take off) I was unable to check in for my flight; it was impossible via the app and online. I called the LATAM support line and they were able to confirm that the error was an internal booking error (i.e. 100% LATAM's fault) which resulted in me not actually having a seat on the first flight. None of the four reps that I talked to (over four hours) could change the ticket or help me out. They told me that my options were to: 1) Cancel my ticket and be refunded, 2) I could pay to 'change' my flights, or 3) they could open a case and someone would call me eventually. A case was opened, however no one called me within the next 12 hours (at which point my flight was 6 hours from takeoff). I called them again (two hours this time) and confirmed with them what my options were and they confirmed that one of them was cancelling the ticket for a refund, so I told them that I wanted to get a refund for my ticket. Suddenly, this was no longer an option and the person couldn't explain why and also couldn't do anything else. The advice that the rep gave me was to ""be patient"" which I find unacceptable. They said I could 'try going to the connecting airport and check in there to see what happens,"" although they separately indicated that if I 'missed' my first flight then the entire trip would be cancelled. About an hour before my first flight was scheduled to take off, I got an email that said ""we tried to reach you"" to address the case however I had no missed calls and it had no instructions to get in touch with them again. I never received a follow up. Even if they had called, it would have been too late to make it to the airport for my flight on time (even if I was standing in the airport lobby when I answered the call) which is unacceptable. I gave LATAM $1200 for a ticket and only gave me headaches and stress.  Their customer service team is not able to fix even basic issues and the customer is expected to pay for the airline's errors. Customer service reps also feel free to hang up on you which happened to me at least three times. I ended up having to buy a whole new ticket for my trip which was almost 2x my original price since, as you can imagine, buying an international flight on the day of the trip isn't going to be cheaper than the original. LATAM's flight schedule changes (a whole other issue that I didn't discuss here, but which cost me and my six travel buddies each 6+ hours on the phone with LATAM) and their other errors cost me $1000+ USD beyond the cost of the initial ticket that I booked.",Family Leisure,March 2022,Iquitos to Lima,Economy Class,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1,no

Can’t really recommend,Kyle Pean,,LATAM Airlines,Trip Verified,"  I had an absolute horrible experience with them. They do not care about their customers. I had a reservation leaving Iquitos Peru through Delta, but the first leg of the flight was flown by LATAM. LATAM could not verify my flight and kept telling me that it was Delta's fault and I needed to talk to them. Delta put my family on five different flights over a 30 hr period and we missed ever single one due to an issue in the LATAM system. The agents in Iquitos Peru airport are rude, do not know what they are doing. They would ignore me when I would talk to them at the counter and would get up from counter and walk away when I would walk up to them. I am extremely disappointed in LATAM and in the agents working in Iquitos Peru. They treated me so poorly.

can't be this incompetent,J Bye,2022-11-24,LATAM Airlines,Trip Verified,"  I will start by saying this is the first review I have ever left for a company, ever, but their severe lack of customer service warrants being mentioned. Just now, nearly four weeks after voicing a concern and 3 weeks after my booked flight took to the air, I am hearing back. In short, I was in Ecuador with a planned flight from Quito to Guayaquil, roundtrip. Do to some major travel complications, including but not limited to civil unrest in Guayaquil, we were going to miss our initial flight. Two of us tried reaching out via Help Center, Email, WhatsApp, and phone call and never heard back. One of us finally got on the phone - after 30 minutes on hold with international rates - to voice our concerns and the representative, 10 minutes into our claim, hung up on us. We were prepared to sacrifice missing the first leg but wanted to ensure that we could still utilize our return flight (Guayaquil to Quito). Instead of responding to any of our claims (attempted almost daily for a week straight) or listening when we did finally get ahold of someone, they cancelled our reservation and kept our money. We were forced to take an overnight bus - as all other flights were fully booked - which cut into a significant part of our travels. As a travel and tourism professional, working in the industry for many years now, I was taken aback at how inaccessible, inflexible, and ultimately unhelpful LATAM was throughout the entire process.

nothing has been returned,H Norton,2022-11-11,LATAM Airlines,Trip Verified," I purchased direct return flights London-Sao Paulo and also 2 internal flights, all with LATAM airlines. I tried to change the internal flights but they wouldn't let me so I had to buy 2 new flights, which I advised them of on the phone and they did not mention that if I miss and legs of the journey that they would cancel my flight home. As a result of missing the original internal flights, my return flight was cancelled automatically and I received absolutely no communication about it. I called LATAM when I wasn't able to check in online as my reservation number no longer worked and they told me there was nothing they could do and that I had to take the hit and buy a new flight home. After 4 hours of anxiety and crying my eyes out, my journey home was rebooked and I had to change flights 3 times with long waits between. To add insult to injury my original direct was boarding at the gate next to mine and I asked if they could let me on. The lady told me she had one seat available but couldn't let me on as the system didn't permit the change. It took me 44 hours to get home.

The cabin crew began to wheel out the service cart from the front of the aisle, took care of the first two rows, and then rolled the cart back to where it was taken from. An unseen person then reached over my shoulder from behind and handed my wife and I each one small bag of nuts. I was waiting for the cart to come back out because I was in the mood for coffee, but it never happened. Everyone past the first two rows weren't even offered water. I looked across the third row and saw someone drinking coffee. I asked why only that person in the third row was served, and I was told that they don't serve coffee to third row passengers because they are in a different flying class. But the first three rows are separated from the rest with a dividing wall. It was only after I had requested for a coffee that I was given one.

During the next layover in Santiago, no one confirmed if we had a checked bag but no one ever confirms. Landed in Sao Paulo and guess what, no bag. The airport said they found it and it was still in Santiago. The next day we got a call from Latam saying they lost it, seriously? Now we've been told to give them 30 days to find it, yeah right.

I was informed the item had not yet been recovered and was instructed to check back after 12 hours of my flight landing. I never received a response - yes or no - about my lost item despite numerous inquiries to the agent who replied to my original message. I don’t expect to have this item returned, but the inability to show the common courtesy of answering me one way or the other has changed my opinion of LATAM.",Couple Leisure,September 2022,Lima to Cusco,Economy Class,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no
Please think twice before using them,R Wilson,2022-09-26,LATAM Airlines,Trip Verified, 11h30m of flying time. 1st meal right after we took off. 2nd meal 5 hour later. Last 5.5 hrs not even a drink service. And I am talking about Biz class. Just main course on both meals. No appetizer or salad. 2.5 hrs before arrival none of the lavatories were working and LATAM made us go all the way to São Paulo without a single lavatory. This was a paid Biz fare so anyone thinks I will make this mistake again? Miss so much TAM. LATAM sucks.,Solo Leisure,September 2022,Manaus to Sao Paulo,Business Class,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2,no

It was 6 hours until the flight. The LATAM person on the phone said he could not help me even in a medical situation, he refused to let me speak to a supervisor. This is bad news an airline that will not accommodate medical needs is to be avoided. I was willing to pay for seat selection, he still would not help. I am medical and will advise my teams to avoid this airline",Business,August 2022,Quito to Auckland via Lima / Santiago,Economy Class,4.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,2,no
changed my opinion of LATAM,Pierre Laville,2022-08-05,LATAM Airlines,Trip Verified,"  Business class on single aisle airplanes with this airline is a scam. Apart from the blocked middle seat, you will be lucky to see a difference with Y class seating arrangements either in width or in row spacing. See photos of Row 2 spacing on the UIO-LIM sector, or the distafful shape of the useless armchair audio commands.

No appetizer or salad,D Walden,,LATAM Airlines,Trip Verified,"  I had 2 bookings with Latam. One of them was cancelled due to Covid so I had a credit. I was told I could get a refund on this credit but they ignored all my requests to do so. The credit has since expired and I am out of pocket by US$503. I'm still trying to get this money back. I have received 2 emails from Latam relating to passengers I’ve never heard of. They give the passenger’s full name and bank account details. It makes me wonder who has been receiving emails with my details. My second booking was also cancelled but successfully rebooked. However Latam then drastically changed the booking - three days were cut from my holiday and the return journey was extended from approx 25 hours travel time to over 41 hours (with 11+ hours stopover in Lima and 11+ hours in Santiago). I have tried to solve these issues in various ways with no help: I visited Latam's office in Quito on 10/5/22. They were no help and referred me to the contact centre. I called the contact centre on the same day, that was no help and claimed her ""system was not working"" and the agent referred me to the Latam website to create a case. I created case number and over 2 months later I have still had no response. I tried to follow up this case and my most recent message to Latam does not even show on their system. On top of this, I was dehydrated on the flight as my requests for water were ignored on more than one occasion. The meals were more like snacks (I am a small female weighing less than 60Kg).",Solo Leisure,March 2022,Asuncion to Buenos Aires,Economy Class,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1,no
flight is going to be cancelled,Connie M. Spataro ,2022-07-30,LATAM Airlines,Not Verified," Miami to Rio de Janeiro. Would never fly with this airline again. We booked airfare on this airline from Miami, FL to Rio de Janeiro, we had booked a cruise that was leaving from Rio, the cruise was canceled and when we tried to receive a travel voucher for future travel we had nothing but problems. We purchased premium business class tickets and the paperwork we were provided stated we had one year in which to use the voucher. After going back and forth with the agent’s too many times to count we were finally given a voucher in the amount of $1274.34, which we used for a trip to Punta Cana, leaving a balance of $694.46.

will not accommodate medical needs,S Warten,2022-07-24,LATAM Airlines,Trip Verified,"  I checked in with my daughter for flight LA6012 at 5.40 pm from ASU (Asuncion) arriving at 8.30 pm in Buenos Aires (AEP). The flight was delayed (the airline claimed bad weather) and left late at 6.25 pm scheduled to arrive at 21.21 pm. The flight was diverted to Uraguay, we were kept in the plane for about 2 hrs and then flown BACK to ASU arriving back where we started around 11.30 pm. They claimed this was due to bad weather in Buenos Aires. According to arrivals at Buenos Aires (AEP), flights AR1645, AR 1227, AR1505 all landed on schedule at AEP at 21.25 (4 mins after our flight was due to arrive), 21.00 and 20.15. Four other flights landed between 20.30 and 21.05 (later than scheduled). The airline did not book us into a hotel, they did not provide food, they simply said to return at 6.30 am for another flight, that flight confirmation has not come through so I am worried. I have to spend the night in the airport with my daughter. This is outrageous, communication has been very poor, no one has looked after us.

lucky to see a difference with Y class,Gu Maia,,LATAM Airlines,Not Verified,"  My Terrible LATAM Travel Experience Returning from Rio de Janeiro to Miami. Upon arriving at the airport in Rio de Janeiro, having checked in online, without having had the option to pay for luggage online, a LATAM employee at the check-in desk informed me that I should pay for the 2 bags that would be checked. I went to the payment desk and the LATAM employee made me wait for 30 minutes to tell me how much the fee would be. He told me it would be R$1,300 reais approximately $125 dollars per bag, totaling approximately $250 dollars.  Not finding the value of the luggage fee right, I paid it, but it is worth noting that on the way to Brazil, with a much more professional and respectful airline, I paid $35 per bag, totaling $70, instead of $250. I went back to the check-in desk and it took approximately 1 hour when I was attended to check in my bags and print my boarding pass. A LATAM employee left the service desk and went to another closed room, came back, did it several times.  When it was close to the boarding time, the LATAM employee said that they would not make the boarding at the scheduled time, as all passengers with carry on should dispatch the same.  Not caring about connecting passengers. There was a long delay in completing this process. When finished, we left Rio towards Santiago. Arriving in Chile, I ran with my 6 year old son and my wife so we wouldn't lose the connection. I arrived at the LATAM connection desk and the employee informed me that I had missed it, there would be no way to catch that flight. I arrived at the counter at 12:10am, flight departs at 12:30am.  That I couldn't pass the connecting gate, I should take a flight to Lima in the morning at 7:45am, I should wait at the airport for more than 7 hours. Detail that the LATAM employee, very moody, didn't even speak English, I had to unroll my Spanish.  As there was no other alternative, I took the boarding pass to Peru and then to the United States. I went to the LATAM VIP Lounge and the employee scanned my boarding pass, but he wouldn't let me in. With all this, I still haven't been able to feed and rest with my 6 year old son and wife. We had to spend the 7 hours in the airport departures area. My son ended up sleeping on the floor of the airport, he was very tired.

still trying to get this money back,J Parelo,,LATAM Airlines,Trip Verified,"  My flight left from Cusco and connected to Lima on my way to New York. No issues on the initial flight. my bag was checked, went through security without any problem. I get to LIMA, had some time to eat, and headed to my gate 25 minutes before departure. Got to the gate, it was mid-boarding, they asked my last name and the staff huddled for a few moments as my G/F and I looked at each other puzzled on what was happening. then I was told ""you need to go with her"" & pointed to a security person. They said my checked bag had a cell phone portable charger in it, picked up via X-RAY, that isn't allowed and needs to be removed. I start walking with this officer who does not speak English. I have no idea where we are going and went all the way back to immigration. As soon as I left, they turned to my G/F and asked if she wanted to board the plane as I was not going to make it back in time for the flight. She asked if they can hold the flight for a few mins so i can get back but they wouldn't even consider it. I get back to the gate and now learn that the gate is closed and I was not making it on the flight. The desk agent said he tried calling us over the PA. As they only have 1 flight out a day, which departs at 12:20AM, 2 hrs later, we were still in the airport, trying to get our bags back and find a hotel to stay at, exhausted and disappointed. the next day, we return to the airport 2 hours earlier then we needed to just to be sure there was going to be no challenges, only to find out an hour later that the flight was cancelled. So noticing that there was a flight leaving to Miami within the next hour at a nearby gate, we ran there to try to talk to the agents to see if we could get on the flight. They did confirm that there were seats, but they said only 1 woman could let us on, who was at the desk, but they wouldn't let us talk to her. We pleaded with one woman who said she'd try to help, then walked away and clearly gave no effort as she was standing next to that woman, texting on her phone. Trying to get her attention, 10 minutes later we had someone get her but she still gave us more excuses. when I asked her the name of the woman that could help us (who she was standing next to work early), she said she didn't know, laughed & walked away. talked to another man who questioned how we knew our flight to NY was cancelled. So now they have everyone waiting on this ridiculously long and slow line to get a hotel credit. after 40 mins waiting & not moving, we left and found our own hotel.",Couple Leisure,July 2022,Quito to Coca,Economy Class,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no

And because of that, they changed our flight telling us the wrong information about what we would get as a compensation. The man said to pick up our luggage in São Paolo. Once we arrived to São Paolo, another man giving vouchers clearly said we shouldn’t pick up our bags because it was directly moved to our final destination. We double (even tripled) asked to make sure as we have been told otherwise, and he assured our bags were on the right track. 12 hours later we arrived finding out that our bags are lost and nowhere to be found even though they had put them on the system even before we got out of the airport. I have been in contact with the airline through WhatsApp asking about my bag status and they only say “it takes time and that I have to wait”. I have asked information about where to go in the airport as I’m flying today to another destination, so I can check directly in the airport but they only can say I need to ask at the airport, not providing any useful information about which terminal or desk should I ask.

I was not making it on the flight,B Lerter,2022-05-19,LATAM Airlines,Trip Verified,  LATAM is fine as long as there are no issues. Our flight got cancelled due to maintenance issues and that's when the trouble started. LATAM personnel is constantly contradicting itself and providing wrong information. They are badly organised in case of a calamity such as a cancellation which causes long and unnecessary waiting times for their costumers under stressful conditions. The company does not give the compensation that it is legally required to provide. The personnel does not seem to care about their customers.

finding out that our bags are lost,P Simpson,2022-05-16,LATAM Airlines,Trip Verified," In January 2020, I bought a round-trip ticket from Sacramento to Lima for June 2020. Subsequently, the trip was cancelled by the tour company due to Covid. I called LATAM and was told that I could hold open my ticket until the next year. My tour was rescheduled for June 2021 and I rebooked flights on LATAM. The 2021 trip was also cancelled by the tour company due to Covid. I spoke by phone with a LATAM agent who told me my ticket would be held open until June 13, 2020. My tour was rescheduled by the tour company for June 2022. In early March 2022, I began trying to rebook my flights. This turned out to be an absolute nightmare and ultimately unsuccessful. I lost track of the number of attempts I made to rebook this ticket, but it had to be over 20. For about a week, I made several calls daily that resulted in waiting for extremely long times for my call to be answered, only to be cut off. I waited about a week before I started calling again. Now my calls were answered, but I couldn’t believe I was dealing with the same airline I had dealt with in 2020 and 2021. With one or two exceptions, every agent had such poor English that it was extremely difficult to communicate, I never really felt they understood what I wanted, and I, in turn, could barely understand them. Several times, I had to tell someone that I would just have to try another agent. The background noise level was extreme. I had to terminate several calls because it was impossible to hear. With one exception, the agents did not seem to know how to do their job. They told me, variously: that I should use the LATAM website (not seeming to know that you can’t use an open ticket on the website, nor book legs on other airlines), that it was not possible to rebook my ticket, that the flight I wanted did not exist (when I was looking at it on the website), that it was impossible to book SMF-LAX with them (after hearing that several times, I dropped the SMF-LAX portion and just focused on LAX-LIM), that I would have to go from LAX to LIM via Santiago and Miami, in that order (two agents told me this). Finally, I got an agent with good English on a clear line, who was able to book exactly what I wanted. When we were nearly finished, he put me on hold - and the call was dropped. That was when I gave up and bought tickets online. I had to book the SMF-LAX leg separately on another airline. I sent all the above information to the airline with my request for a refund of the $2198.09 I'd paid for the original ticket. After a very long time, they told me I could not have a refund because I'd been told in the beginning that I should rebook my open ticket.",Solo Leisure,June 2021,Brisbane to Buenos Aires via Auckland,First Class,3.0,3.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,1,no
I still don't have my money,Angela Hogan,2022-05-14,LATAM Airlines,Not Verified,"  Booked to go from Auckland to Peru and then back again. Half way through our holiday they cancelled our flight home. Had to spend two days of the holiday trying to sort out flights home. They gave us one option - leave three weeks later going via Brazil. When we complained they then gave us another option to go via Los Angeles on the day were were supposed to leave but then left us to sort out our ESTA visas to go through USA. I had to ring the UK to get my UK passport number as I was travelling on my NZ passport so that was more cost to me. We had paid for extra leg room seats, never got that money back! So our trip home to NZ was Lima to LA, LA to Sydney Australia (on Qantas) and then Sydney to Auckland with Qantas. Our original flight from Lima to Auckland was available with Qantas their partner airline but because we had booked originally through LATAM they could not arrange us to go with Qantas, yet they could from LA and Sydney. Go figure. We then had to pay again for extra legroom seats which when we got on the plane the cabin crew knew nothing about and I had to complain and show them the payment receipt as LATAM had given us the wrong boarding passes. The cabin crew then gave the other seats in extra legroom to other passengers who had not paid! We were treated dreadfully on the LATAM flight. Was soooo glad to board Qantas flights - we had to pay a extra for their leg room seats but once the crew had heard of our plight the Qantas crew made us feel so comfortable and brought us treats. When we got home I wrote to LATAM to tell them of our experience and they could not be bothered, we do not give refunds was their response. I got really annoyed with them and their couldn't be bothered response and informed them as as a travel and tourism teacher I would using their customer service as an example of not what to do. They are now a case study in my class and the students pretend to be useless LATAM customer service and flight crew and the students critique what was bad service and what a good airline company should do. I use the emails they send and even have a script which the students use. So one positive came out of the experience. The annoying thing is that I want to go back to South America but the thought of flying this useless crew is so off putting. Even if I book with Qantas you may end up with this bunch. My advice for anyone thinking of booking with LATAM / or forced to book with them - warn your employees you may be three weeks later back to work. Take all documentation needed to enter a variety of different countries around the world so you meet their visa requirements and also currencies of those countries so you can by a drink while waiting in the numerous airport lounges you will be forced to wait in.

"if you like your luggage, don't fly LATAM",Ali Manderson,2022-05-13,LATAM Airlines,Not Verified,"  Totally underwhelmed by this airline. In the first instance, ticket was expensive. The food service for the short leg of the trip from Brisbane to Auckland was pathetic. Even worse for the Auckland to Santiago leg with the main meal being a dried piece of chicken breast with a small portion of plain rice. It was served on a flat discardable plate with aluminium foil covering. It did not look appealing at all. Not warm enough, chicken hard to cut with plastic cutlery, needless to say the meal was very dried and cold. We were served a cold bread roll with no butter. Only one round of drinks. Breakfast was an omelette however, it didn’t have any ham or cheese. Seats are very uncomfortable. Not enough cushioning. I had to wait 4 hours to catch my flight from Santiago to Buenos Aires. This was not the case when I booked the flight - only 1.5 hours transit. Their app is totally useless, you don’t get any alerts, emails or text messages to the various changes they made to my itinerary. My flight back was even worse. They changed my transit time from Buenos Aires to Santiago from 1.5 hours to 10.5 hours. It took me two days to get back home, totally exhausting. I do not recommend this airline. It seems to me that it’s closer to being a budget airline even though prices are not. I wasn’t even asked for feedback so i guess not interested in pleasing their customers.

They advanced my flight 2h, I was coming in with an international connection and had my boarding pass. I show up at the airport and the flight is not programmed, instead of being guided, I was forced to do a super long line (baggage drop off) at 4am in the morning, fight to get my luggage, and fight to get a flight rescheduled. Apparently this was all the ""weather"".

To begin my travels, in Cusco, where I was told I must be approved to enter Chile or I could not leave for Lima. I provided my very recent (3-hour-old) negative Covid test and tried to download the c19 paperwork, as those were the two stated requirements. There was technical trouble with downloading the document, but the LATAM rep said no worries, it is not that important. You have your Covid test, vaccines and boosters, US documents, etc. LATAM approved me to Chile. (Personal Note: My daughter, who was teaching English in Cuzco had been sick with stomach pain, so if I was not approved, I would have stayed in Cuzco with her.) In Lima, they said the representative in Cuzco was wrong, and I could not go to Chile. I was there hours early. So, I asked for help in getting this document, and they blew me off! Would not help. Essentially, they triaged me and helped all others, mostly Latin Americans. They further assured me three different times a certain gentleman was in charge of the flight would make sure everything cleared. Every time I went to speak with him, he brushed me off. Furthermore, they snuck behind my back, lied to me about getting me on, then asked me my name and passport number so they could pull my luggage from the flight because they knew no one at LATAM would help me.

No one could tell me the price of a second piece of luggage,Paul Turner,2022-03-16,LATAM Airlines,Not Verified,"  Terrible experience with LATAM Airlines after booking return Business Premium seats between London and Rio De Janeiro. The airline changed our flight times, dates, flight sectors and completely voided whole sectors from our trip multiple times without notification or explanation. I would notice the changes purely by chance via Checkmytrip.com. Following each change I would dutifully endure LATAM's service call centre for several hours, incorporating dozens of call disconnections, excuses and down right lies ranging from the flight has been cancelled to the flight no longer has availability, all while still selling our seats for said ""cancelled, or unavailable"" flights on their app and website - this they explained by lying that their website was glitching (for 3 months?) The changes made by LATAM to our booking over the course of a few weeks amounted to the following. The flight we booked (London to Rio de Janeiro (via Sao Paulo) dep 24th Feb and return to London 11th March) becoming London to Rio de Janeiro (via Sao Paulo) dep 25th Feb, return 11th March. Then London to Madrid dep 24th Feb, Madrid to Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo to Rio de Janeiro; then London to Frankfurt dep 24th Feb, Frankfurt to Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo to Rio de Janeiro; Then our return flight began to change without notification or explanation, changed from the flight we booked: Rio de Janeiro to Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo to London dep 11th Mar, which became 4.) Rio de Janeiro dep 11th Mar to Belo Horizonte, Belo Horizonte to Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo to London; then  Rio de Janeiro dep 11th Mar to Brasilia, Brasilia to Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo to London; then  Rio de Janeiro to Campinas, Sao Paulo to London (How do I get from Campinas to Sao Paulo??) then Sao Paulo to London (So now I have to get from Rio to Sao Paulo on my own?). This then culminated in the next change being made to our booking resulting in no return flight at all. After hours and hours on the phone to Customer Services without being offered any explanation or alternative return flight, we decided to continue with the outward journey via Frankfurt and fight it out face to face once in Brazil. On arrival at London Heathrow with bags backed to board the flight to Frankfurt, the check-in agent told us apologetically that we would be unable to board as LATAM had invalidated the ticket for the London to Frankfurt sector. The ticket was on the system but LATAM had not reserved the seats. We were advised to contact Customer services and ask LATAM to Validate the tickets. Invariably the LATAM agent I spoke with hung up on me and we had no where to go. As LATAM had not reserved the seats to Frankfurt via Lufthansa there weren't even seats available for us to purchase directly from Lufthansa to ensure we could make our onward connection to Sao Paulo. The distress and anguish we experienced as a result of LATAM's blatant disregard for their customers was like nothing I'd ever experienced with any other airline. As LATAM contract out their ticketing service to a third party agent (dnata) at London Heathrow, we had no option but to try and explain our situation to the third party agent. This dnata agent incredible and everything that LATAM wasn't. She listened to us, empathised with us and committed to us that she would help resolve the nightmare LATAM had placed us in. She re-booked us back onto or original flight (which LATAM had repeatedly refused to do). Avoid at all costs!",Business,January 2022,Lima to Cusco,Business Class,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no

Our return trip from Santiago Chile was no different. We arrived at Mexico city airport to find out our connecting flight to YVR Vancouver had been cancelled, and yet again not one person working for LATAM in the airport was available to help us. Aeromexico was able to book us a flight home to Vancouver BC. LATAM has done nothing to help us besides cost us money in hotel stays, food and phone calls to LATAM trying to get some help.

unwelcome as a customer,Skinner Howard Arteaga Leon,,LATAM Airlines,Trip Verified,"  Staff were very rude, during the flight, the check in was Very disorganized on my way back to US, staff knew a flight got cancel to NY but still other flights were pending during this time. Instead of opening 1 or 2 windows to deal with the NY flight the staff decided to leave it like that and keep All 8 check in stations stuck with fixing a flight that isn’t leaving that night? And make us the other destination passengers (LAX / MIA) wait standing up for 3 hours. On the check in line, we even have time to rush thru Imigration & Customs, this is very unacceptable. I came 4 hours before my flight to be able to eat something in the airport, instead because this incompetent team though it was a good idea to keep everyone waiting and react at the last minute on passengers who were about to miss flights? LAX flight passengers were very outset, why they staff didn’t listen to the advise everyone was suggesting? They just walk away and ignore everyone! This is hospitality to you?

I almost missed my flight,B James,,LATAM Airlines,Trip Verified," This was the worst service I’ve ever experienced on an airline, and I’m a million-miler on one US carrier and have flown hundreds of thousands of miles on other airlines, including many on Asian budget carriers. Anyhow, my flight LA4297, from CTG-MDE was delayed by 3 hours from 08.51 am to 11.45 am. I had purchased a premium-economy ticket. (On these short-haul flights in Columbia, they only have premium-economy and regular economy seats). When I went to board LA4297, after experiencing the 3 hour delay in a crowded waiting hall during the Omicron surge, the gate agent told me I was bumped to a later flight, LA4295, that departed around 50 minutes after LA4297. Must have been bumped for a VIP, otherwise, they would have bumped a passenger from regular economy class. So I paid more for my seat and got lousier service. When I finally arrived in MDE, four hours after my original scheduled time, my suitcase was nowhere to be found. And nobody from Latam was in baggage-claim to help me. Luckily, an employee from Avianca, the Colombian national carrier, felt sorry for me and helped me find Latam’s office. So after walking 3/4ths of the way around the airport and killing another 1/2 hour, I was able to locate my suitcase that came-in on LA4297. I’m 70 years old. Later, I tried to file a complaint on-line for Latam using their forms.

worst service ever,Craig Scott,2022-01-19,LATAM Airlines,Not Verified," Avoid this airline in Brazil! Totally unreliable. Had two flights canceled. Rescheduled flights caused extra expenses and inconvenience. In one case, the new flight made my US flight connection too tight and at risk of another cancellation or delay. So I had to pay for another flight on GOL at double the cost so I could make my United flight to the US. Could not change my flight, despite airline cancellation, on Mytrip.com, whose US phone number was unavailable from Brazil. LATAM could not put me on a flight that would let me make United flight.

No ground support at GRU for connecting passengers who missed their connections. The plane originally landed in Paris at 2PM for a 9:25PM departure.

Middle seat is empty. Which is also valuable in Covid times. Boarding was completely chaotic, and unacceptable due to the pandemic. Priority passenger were not called. As aircraft was on remote position everyone was in a completely packed bus, with a lot of children (Dec 23rd).

Terrible customer service,Graeme Liddon,2021-12-17,LATAM Airlines,Trip Verified," Flying as a family of 4, we purchased tickets from Lima to Buenos Aires with a short layover in Santiago leaving on 15th December. Latam changed our flight times repeatedly, changing both the date of departure and the arrival airport leaving us with a 10 hour layover from the early hours which we had to endure sleepless and uncomfortable in Santiago. We were told we could change the flights if we weren't happy but there were none available. Latam were not interested in the fact they had changed the date of travel, had added a long overnight layover in spite of the fact we had originally paid extra to avoid that. We were all exhausted upon arrival (plus the usual inedible flight ""food"") and I will be avoiding this airline in future.",Family Leisure,September 2021,Barcelona to Sao Pulo,Economy Class,2.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,2,no
Check-in extremely friendly,Daniel Castellon,,LATAM Airlines,Not Verified,"  Absolutely unacceptable airline. I called them to check-in, because I made an offer to upgrade. When I called, I asked for the price to do a direct upgrade instead of waiting for the upgrade offer. I wasn't happy with the price, so declined. Somehow in this process, they changed my seat from 15L - a nice window seat in the Latam+ area - to 23H - a seat with no built-in monitor, a wall in front so nowhere to keep my backpack with me during the flight, and right behind the bathrooms. I called back (a 45 minute wait each time) only to be told (after another 20 minutes of simply asking my name and verifying my reservation code) that there was nothing they could do. They couldn't move me back, there weren't any good seats left (the flight is the next day, 12/3), and that maybe I should check at the airport and see if they can move me. I spent over $100 for the original seat. No way to get a refund because technically, ""23H is still a Latam+ seat at the same price"". This is a 10 hour flight from JFK to Sao Paulo. This is not the only time I've had trouble with them. Every time I need to make a change, do a check-in, or anything after a purchase, I have to call because their website never works, or simply displays a message saying I cannot make any changes unless I call.

crew on board was extremely friendly,H Sears,2021-11-12,LATAM Airlines,Trip Verified,"  Nothing positive to report from this trip review. Flight was four hours late, missed onward connection to Florianopolis, forced to overnight at GRU. LATAM had apparently organized hotel bookings for us and I received my voucher upon arrival. Unfortunately when we got to the hotel the hotel had no rooms and they claimed LATAM never confirmed any of the bookings with them. LATAM was unreachable to resolve this problem. We tried on social media channels and five different phone numbers. Basically all of us were left to fend for ourselves. Ultimately secured my own room at another hotel and got myself there. Zero chance of being reimbursed by LATAM who refuses to respond to my queries on Twitter. At GRU was told there is not one person who could help resolve this despite it being a hub airport - they said I have to call them - we tried multiple times with no success. They have been completely unresponsive since the problem has occurred and their customer service is less than zero. Their lack of competence is outdone only by their lack of integrity. As for the flight itself, their B767 product is antiquated, circa 1990 in look and feel, badly in need of refurbishment. Seats uncomfortable, 2x2x2 configuration offer no privacy. IFE did not work properly and hardware was falling apart. Business class headphones were the same cheap plastic as economy and they had some dog ate the homework excuse as to why they didn't have the noise cancelling or noise reducing variety that made no sense. Needless to say I'd avoid LATAM and this aircraft for all of said reasons unless you absolutely need to fly them. They are a nightmare to deal with, are extraordinarily unethical in their dealings with customers and they need to be called out for what they are - basically a bunch of frauds.

will be avoiding,M Warren,2021-10-17,LATAM Airlines,Trip Verified," Lima to Los Angeles. LATAM Airlines in flight services and rules and regulations are terrible! For domestic flights they provide no in flight services like drinks or snacks. They do not let you stand up altogether after the plane is secured at the gate, and instead require you to stand only by aisle/row. And they are currently requiring a double face mask mandate, even when traveling to or landing in a country which does not require any such mandate. We felt like we were being governed by a police force when on a domestic flight we, in Row 3, tried to stand and get our carry-on luggage. A flight attendant absolutely refused let us stand, and stated that only Row 1 could stand up at that time. On an international flight, Rows 1 - 18 were allowed to stand and get their luggage, but our Row 22 could not. We have never before seen an airline regulate when specific rows of passengers can get their luggage once the plane is securely docked at the gate. During our travel, Peru and LATAM Airlines required a two face mask mandate in all airports and on all airplanes. When we were returning to the United States, they still required this mandate, even though we were in U.S. airspace and landing at a U.S. airport. This seemed a bit extreme and unnecessary to us, especially considering it is more difficult to breathe with two masks and your glasses fog considerably.

I needed to change the flight's date so I paid an additional $40 for that change. LATAM took the $40, but would not confirm a new seat which means I could get stuck in Campo Grande. This lack of confirmation went on for over a month. After phoning them more times than I can say, they said they'd give me a refund for the $40 change request if I withdrew the request, so I did. I never received the refund. Moreover, when I complained that my original ticket is now worthless because I needed a flight date change, they refunded me $5 for the original ticket. The original ticket was $151.10.  Compare with American Airlines where I had to make similar changes -- they refunded me within minutes. I have lodged a dispute with Citibank because I used their credit card to pay for the original ticket as well as the change request.

I typically select window seats in the rear side of the cabin, as I think they are somewhat more private, especially with everyone tending to sit as close to the front as possible. Thus my seat was 5A with no one sitting next to me, and that was perfect. The flight was delayed, and the flight attendants asked me to give away my seat for additional crew required because of the delay and move to an aisle seat with someone sitting next to me. Great touch, especially that there were plenty of vacant seats on the flight. The food wasn't edible at all - they brought a frozen omelet for breakfast.

had to cancel one at a time,L Meares,2020-12-29,LATAM Airlines,Trip Verified,"  It has been several times that I have claimed reimbursement for my plane tickets whose flight has been canceled. The first time on June 4, 2020. Latam advised me that the refund would take 15 days, I'm still waiting! In the meantime I have received vouchers, which do not work: I wanted to pay for my last flights with and they were refused. This company is a company of thieves: they promise and do not not keep their promises. They don't even know how to use a translator and force you to send your request in a language that is not yours. Again the answer to my complaint is that I have vouchers to use (which don't not work!) and if I keep asking for the refund, it will take a long time. Cela fait plusieurs fois que je réclame le remboursement de mes billets d'avion dont le vol a été annulé. La première fois le 4 juin 2020. Latam m'a avisé que le remboursement prendrait 15 jours, J'attends toujours! Entre temps j'ai reçu des voucher, qui ne fonctionnent pas: j'ai voulu payer mes derniers vols avec et ils ont été refusés..... Ils promettent et ne tiennent pas leurs promesses.  Ils ne savent même pas utiliser un traducteur et vous obligent à envoyer votre demande dans une langue qui n'est pas la vôtre. Une nouvelle fois la réponse à ma réclamation est que j'ai des vouchers à utiliser (qui ne fonctionnent pas!) et si je persiste à demander le remboursement, ça prendra beaucoup de temps.

I never received the refund,Thomas Pederson,2020-12-09,LATAM Airlines,Not Verified,"  You always hear horror stories here and there about flying. I have had the occasional late leaving kinds of things and what I thought was going to be the worst flight I ever took I missed a connection in Toronto once in winter and had to stay in the airport for over 20 hours to catch the next one. I couldnt sleep because of the valuable camera gear in my bag with me I am also over 6 feet tall so when i got on an earlier leaving plane than I was scheduled I did it even though it was a middle seat and I had to put my bag under the seat in front of me. When I got to my destination i could barely walk. I thought that was going to be the worst flight and I travel a ton using at least 3 big trips a year and a couple small ones. Well then I decided to go to Antarctica. I had seen reviews and heard stories but its a once in a lifetime trip so off I go. I planned extra days in cities going down so I could help eliminate all potential problems. Rather than try to get connecting flights i stayed a night in each major city. Going down went fine all went as planned but to get home with lined up flights I wasnt able to do the same plan but I had my flights way in advance was going to the airport like 6 hours early to start and I figured i was set. I did not plan on Latam airlines though. I dont think anyone could plan for such a terrible airline. It started with them overbooking my first flight out of Punta Arenas. They overbooked the flight by 12 people which meant I was missing my connection in Santiago which again would had been with Latam airlines. My checked luggage had been put on my original flight. They had told me someone would be at my gate to help me. Was there? NOPE. Could I find anyone even near my gate when I landed? NOPE. could I get any help what so ever from the crew on the plane? NOPE. I did notice a couple that I had talked to in Punta Arenas was in the same situation. They had befriended someone that lived in Santiago to try and help them. They could speak the language and they took us to place after place trying to get us help. Zero help anywhere. After about 80 minutes of running around the airport with them i heard from my friends. They were staying in Santiago for the night and they thought they had seen my bag behind a desk. I had gone out of security though and couldnt get back in. I dont know how they did it but they sweet talked a guy there and were able to get him to bring it out to me and have me verify it was mine. Frankly I had wrote the bag off. I was out of options so I left with my friends into Santiago. It was about 11:30pm at this time. They had one night booked so the minute i got to airport i was calling the ""help"" line. after a couple hours all I could do was book a flight the next day with a different airline. My trip cost went up another $1,000 to do this but I was told I would be refunded at least my original cost. Well that was over 11 months ago. I have provided my banking info multiple times, have had countless emails saying it was being worked on and its been 11 months of nothing. I am not a complainer and I hardly give reviews but do everything in your power, stay extra days, take a bus, anything to avoid this airline.

LATAM is a complete fiasco!,Gianfranco Carroso,2020-12-07,LATAM Airlines,Not Verified,"  Worst experience of my life. The day of my trip arrived 4 hours before I found out at that moment that my flight had been canceled. I called LATAM 7 TIMES, the first time he told me that the flight had been canceled and that he did not know the reason but that he could put me on a DELTA flight. when I go to the Delta entrance. He tells me that he had problems and that DELTA did not confirm. At that he told me to wait and I HANG UP the call. I call back and they tell me that I am not registered for any flight. Explain the situation and the guy named Alejandro hangs up the call. 1 hour and 15 minutes had passed and I still had no news of what to do. Like this for 5 times. On the sixth time he tells me one that can put me on a flight for 3 days later. Or that I could wait for the Latam line that opened at 9:04 PM 6 hours later to solve the problem and put me on another flight. Since I had driven 4 hours, I decided to wait until 9 for the LATAM person to tell me that they couldn't do anything and that I should call 1800 #.They did not give me the trip that they had offered me 3 days later because it was Canceled. I asked for a refund and I'm still waiting.  La.peor experiencia de mi vida. Llegue el dia de mi viaje 4 horas antes pera enterarme en ese momento que mi vuelo habia sido cancelado. Llamo 7 VECES a LATAM , la primera me dijo que el vuelo habia sido cancelado y que no sabia el motivo pero que podia ponerme en un vuelo de DELTA. cuando me voy a la entrada de Delta. Me dice que tenia problemas y que DELTA no le confirmaba. En eso me dijo que esperara y ME COLGO la llamada. Llamo para atras y me dicen que no estoy registrado en ningun vuelo . explique la.situacion y el tipo llamado alejandro me cuelga la.llamada. ya habia pasado 1 hora y 15 min y aun no tenia noticias de que hacer.

"Never again, it's not worth the money",S Carliga,2020-12-04,LATAM Airlines,Not Verified,"  I would have liked to provide my ticket or proof of my flights but not even that has been sent to me, Latam has me in limbo, they left to send everything to my email and days of my trip they have not sent anything, only on their page is my route back and what is worse, they arbitrarily canceled the last leg of my trip to get home and sent some text messages, with a link, to my son's phone where he says I can reschedule my canceled flight. Now when I want reschedule the flight on the page there is a message saying ""sorry, your reservation can only be rescheduled through our contact center"". Try calling the call center and they cut the call. This airline was paid $415 for the date change, it has been impossible to obtain proof of payment from them, now moreover, after having paid them for the date changes, they cancel the last section. I understand that these days in the south of Chile there will be an eclipse of the sun and the flight has not been canceled, the issue is that they have high demand for tickets and they are selling more expensive tickets and what better way to get off the plane than who made the flight change in advance and payment cheaper.

On the flight, this was not granted and was informed by the cabin crew that she could request a tariff refund online. When she arrived, I requested the refund through their customer service channel, and they simply cancelled her return flight. They refuse to have this rectified and told me that I had to purchase a new flight, obviously closer to the date that costs double the amount I originally paid for it. I tried speaking to their customer service over the phone, which are useless. They put you on hold for nearly an hour to get connected, and when you do, after telling them the problem, they put me on hold and simply hang up.

its been 11 months of nothing,A Maloro,2020-11-05,LATAM Airlines,Trip Verified,"  At the beginning of June 2020 I bought my ticket to go from El Calafate to Salta with a stopover in Buenos Aires. That same month, they informed me that my flights had been canceled and that, as I had paid with a credit card, they would refund the entire amount within a maximum period of 3 months. It was not true. After the 3 months they told me, I requested a refund through their website, but I have not had a response. I have also tried it through chat and phone but I have only been left on hold for more than 1 hour. 6 months have passed and it is clear that they do not want to return my money, but I am willing to take them to court if necessary.

Then they reissued the ticket one day before the flight when we didn't even have a chance of being there.

World’s Best Airports in 2025,Alina Rus,2020-10-05,LATAM Airlines,Not Verified,"  This is a company that offers highly priced tickets to Easter Island with 100% refund policy in case of cancellation, while in reality they never pay the rightful amount for our case dated 11/2019 although we went through their tedious refund process, wrote them 20 emails, writing them minimum 40 Facebook Messages and calling them on our cost over 20x. We flown several times with them, and although they had serious issues with the online checking, our last experience with them convinced us avoid them forever. We had two flights scheduled from Santiago to Easter Island and Buenos Aires to El Calafate, both cancelled due to the civil crisis (Contingencia Chile) from in November 2020. Although we had 100% refundable tickets we never seen our money back from LATAM although we initiated this refund process 11 months ago. Our case has the same status since 8-9 months “in payment process” but the money never reached out bank account. They keep telling us that they are working on our case, but their credibility is 0 especially as I have seen that we are not the only ones waiting our money almost one year! They tried to argue that the Pandemic of Covid-19 increased the number of cases they have to process, but we have initiated our refund process 3,5 months before the pandemic started, therefore there is no excuse whatsoever. Worse is that I read on their Facebook page, lots of complaints of same nature, so I concluded that this is usual practice not an accident. Their customer service is a disaster and a total waste of time. Is like hitting a dead end with them! I definitely won’t recommend such a miserable operator.

I have been fighting to get my money returned from LATAM Airlines after I purchased flights in Early Jan this year to see my girlfriend in Colombia. (before Covid came about). My flights got canceled in late March and they said they would be offering travel vouchers. To this day I have not received any valid travel vouchers. When they did finally send some vouchers after 3 months, they misspelt my last name (despite providing my passport) and other identifying info. LATAM advised me that they would have to open a new case and it would then take longer to process (despite it being their fault). To this day I’ve not received a single phone call (pretty much 0 contact from them from get go). LATAM finally emailed after I called their NZ number about 50 times.

For six consecutive months, I'm not able to get a refund (even in the form of vouchers) from the company. Please see my posts below. They are constantly delaying issuing the vouchers without any explanation. They tell you an expected time and at the end of the period they tell you double the time is needed. We lost thousands of USD to them. If you contemplate booking a ticket with them, please be aware of the fact, that in case your flight is cancelled (which is probable scenario these days) you won't see your money again, because they will not refund them.

We were supposed to receive vouchers for taxes / fees vouchers in the amount of 160 USD per passenger. They managed to deliver two out of four vouchers. Reason unknown. We were supposed to receive vouchers for 20% of the fare (it was a voluntary pre Covid request) in the amount of 130 USD per passenger. They managed to send them out all but all of them state wrong amount of 10 USD. Reason unknown. Really, everything this company do, they do it wrong.

Due to corona related border closure between Czech Republic and Germany, we were not able to board our flight and we voluntarily cancelled our tickets on Mar 13th. Its five months later and we still did not receive money refund nor a voucher for our tickets. This by the way prohibits us from approaching insurance company and retrieve the rest of the money. Call centre service is apalling. During last five months I experienced passivity and unwilligness to solve our case - refund request mistreated multiple times when operators put wrong or uncomplete data into system - complete unwillingness to give this case some priority after five months - obvious lies or incompetence (constantly changing info bout form of refund and time schedule) - when promised to be called back, it never happened - one operator providing different info from the other I know airlines have a hard time now, but this airline customer service is in complete disarray.

While overseas I requested a change in flights from one of the ground staff and she said this was fine and she would organise that for us. Without letting us know LATAM then cancelled our flights totalling 2.5k dollars. They refused to accept their own staff members mistake and instead quoted us a flight home 3 weeks earlier than we were supposed to fly for another $2k. Then after over a week of back and forth they gave us back 2 of our 5 remaining flights for $1k (meaning we paid 3.5k for a return trip). The staff were unhelpful and the company has policies in place to abandon travellers in foreign countries with no contact information. They also managed to overbook the flight that they eventually gave us and tried to delay us for a day, without offering to pay for accomodation.

frustrated waiting for a refund,Heather Martinez,2020-03-30,LATAM Airlines,Trip Verified,"  Santiago to Punta Arenas. Traveling with a group of 4 throughout Chile. Chose to travel with LATAM for all 5 flights and it’s been a stressful experience from the beginning! My name was processed incorrectly and the Ms. was added to the end of my first name rather than as the title. That required that I spent additional time checking in and explaining to officials the error. Then, at SCL (Santiago, Chile) for flight to Puerto Natales scheduled to leave at 1120am was overbooked. Two of us were able to board the flight and myself and another passenger were asked to switch flights. The new flight would be the next day. This means that all activities, the car rental and hotel reservation we’ve paid for that day would be lost. After complaining they were willing to fly us out to Punta Arenas and Pay for our transportation to the hotel for the same day. Plus an additional cash credit of $640 USD and food card. Once all of the changes were processed we were given a cash voucher of only $160 USD and we’re expected to arrive to our hotel at 10 pm. After waiting in the airport for at least 5 hours, flying to an airport that’s at least another 5 hours away from our hotel and wasting an entire day of activities that have already been paid for. Not to mention that this has been a trip that we’ve planned for months. The time spent, stress and forgone activities are not compensated by a $160 voucher.

never fly with Latam again,J Liosatos,2020-03-15,LATAM Airlines,Not Verified,"  It is understandable that delays happen, however, what I have experienced at the early hours of 14 March is appalling. Travelling with my family and a small child we have experienced a nearly 2hr delay to wait for additional passengers. It is now 2.20am and we were meant to take off at 12.40pm. I had to ask an attendant for something for our child to eat, and could not achieve a warm meal. There was no perceived care about the comfort and hunger of the existing passengers. Stating, they cannot serve food until they are in the air? Most people would generally be asleep now. I would have expected a higher level of courtesy and common sense given the current circumstances. This experience has led me to believe a great level of improvement is needed. There were other issues I am too tired to describe here. Having flown numerous airlines, we will not fly LATAM again. I am curious to see what the airline company will do, if any, to compensate it’s passengers.",Family Leisure,November 2019,New York to Guayaquil,Economy Class,3.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1,no
extremely disappointed by LATAM,Michael Rubio,2020-03-08,LATAM Airlines,Trip Verified,"  Bogota to Medellin. LATAM is the airline that treats its frequent travelers the worst and I hope that what happened to me will never happen to anyone anymore because they hurt me economically and logistically on Decembrinas dates, I arrived with more time in advance than normal to a national flight so that no inconvenience occurred to me and the airline changed the waiting room along with the boarding gate without notifying me, having my check-in registered at the airport, my email and my phone number, they never let me know. Only when I went to ask why they did not call us on board did they simply tell me that I could no longer board because the flight was closed and that I had lost it. When I claim they deny me that they have changed the room and they treated me super badly at the counter, I went to Civil Aeronautics who did not give me a solution either and in OPAIN they deny the version of LATAM, they indicate that indeed the room was changed and they specify the time .... For all this I have recordings as support, it cannot be that they hurt 5 PAX (3 of them unknown to me) and that the same thing happened to us ... The airline has not responded until today 07-MAR-2020 with a case that I have been claiming since 23-DEC-2019. LATAM es la aerolínea que peor trata a sus viajeros frecuentes y espero que lo que me paso a mi no le pase nunca mas a nadie pues me perjudicaron económica y logísticamente en fechas Decembrinas, llegue con mas tiempo de anticipación de lo normal a un vuelo nacional para que no se me presentaran inconvenientes y la aerolínea me cambió la sala de espera junto con la puerta de embarque sin avisarme, teniendo mi check in registrado en aeropuerto, mi correo electrónico y mi teléfono, nunca me avisaron. Solo cuando me dirigí a preguntar por que no nos llamaban a embarcar me dijeron simplemente que ya no podía abordar porque el vuelo estaba cerrado y que lo había perdido. Cuando reclame me niegan haber cambiado la sala y me trataron super mal en el counter, me dirigí a Aeronáutica Civil quienes no me dieron una solución tampoco y en OPAIN desmienten la versión de LATAM, indican que efectivamente la sala si fue cambiada y especifican la hora.... Para todo esto tengo grabaciones como soporte, no puede ser que nos perjudicaron a 5 PAX (3 de ellos desconocidos para mi) y que nos pasara lo mismo...

Furthermore, my flight from NYE to GYE was cancelled due to mechanical issues after waiting on the plane for 4.5hrs - I understand things happen and planes break. It would have be nice if the staff figured out what hotel we would be at sooner and actually given us the right information on how to get to said hotel instead of just saying “there is a bus”.

no on-demand vegan options,Rocio Chalco Quintero,2020-02-07,LATAM Airlines,Not Verified,"  Lima to Los Angeles. We have had so many issues with this airline. We have been flying this airline for about 10 years and the past two years there has been great administrative changes and we have had horrible experiences trying to buy tickets to fly to Peru and Australia. Last year my husband made a group reservation to fly with a group of people to Peru and while we were on vacation in Thailand in March we found out that Latam had not issued the tickets that had been purchased and charged to our credit card for the trip to Peru in June. He had to jump through hoops to get them to issue the tickets because we needed to get confirmation for the flights for everyone on the group trip. Last December 2019 we purchased tickets to fly to Peru on new years vacation and we were not able to pay for the tickets online with our credit card. We had to call a family member in Peru so that they could purchase our tickets in Peru because their system would not take our payment. About a week later we tried to purchase tickets to fly to Australia together. My husband was not able to buy our tickets on the same order he had to buy his ticket separate from mine. Why? Because their system would not accept payment for both tickets online. This is outrageous!!! So, he had to buy both his ticket and my ticket separately. Before we flew to Peru this past December, we checked to make sure everything was ok with the reservations to Australia and long and be hold, they issued my ticked but they did not issue his ticket even though they charged the credit card. So, this is where all the trouble started again with Latam. My husband started calling them asking them why they had not issued his ticket to Australia, they said they would in time, to keep checking back and gave us a case number #21164675. While we were in Peru we went to a Latam center and they said that our case was not important, that they needed to focus on other cases that had flights sooner then ours to Australia. We kept calling and checking with them and we got to nothing. Then they said there was an issue with my husbands member number and told us to call another number to get a telephone code so we could get another case number. Then they said we needed to call their Brazil office to deal with the issue. We kept getting the run around and no answers!!! We were in Peru for a month and all this time nothing was resolved with Latam. They eventually cancelled my husbands ticket to Australia and refunded the money without advising us. But now we are left with my ticket. So we are trying to cancel my ticket to Australia but we get nowhere with this company. Same excuses! they send us from here to there with no solution and I'm so sick and tired of this lack of professionalism and waste of our valuable time. They gave us a case number for this ticket and now a week away from when our flight was, we still have no resolution to this chaos. I do not recommend this airline at all anymore!!! take your money elsewhere. Don't waste your valuable time. While we were trying to resolve this issue in the Lima office there was another lady there with the same issue. for no reason Latam cancelled her husbands ticket to Peru. I have looked on their facebook page and so many people are complaining about this airline not refunding their money.  They need to get their act straight.

treats frequent travelers the worst,R Sanyal,,LATAM Airlines,Trip Verified,"  LATAM impressed me greatly. I took a roundtrip flight from Buenos Aires (AEP) to Ushuaia, both outbound and inbound flights were on schedule. The flight was full of tourists. No business class on these flights. Flight attendants provided two beverage services and a snack. Announcements were in Spanish and English. Boarding was smooth. Attendants were pleasant. Our window seats provided dramatic views over Ushuaia. The airline is a member of One World alliance and my status was fully respected. On our return, our tour company misplaced one of our bags and we had to leave Ushuaia without it. We informed the LATAM ground agent in Ushuaia that our bag may have been mistakenly taken by another member of our tour group. The agents swung into action. They got in touch with the tour company. I gave them my address of the hotel in Buenos Aires. When we checked in at the hotel, the desk clerk informed us that the missing bag had been found and would arrive by a later flight at night and LATAM would deliver it to our hotel. It did -- in good shape. It was service beyond expectation. We thought we would never receive it. LATAM's crew in Ushuaia and Buenos Aires ensured our holiday ended on a positive note.

trip was failed from the start,L Rodriguez,2020-01-16,LATAM Airlines,Not Verified,"  This was my first time flying with LATAM and most definitely my last. Our flight from Florianopolis to São Paulo went by with no hitches but when we landed everything started to turn for the worse. My brother and I had arrived at our gate an hour early and made sure to say hello to the worker at the gate desk. Once it got time to our boarding, I noticed no one was at the hate still which I thought strange. I walked up to the worker which is when she informed me that my connecting flight to New York was cancelled and I had to walk across the airport to the LATAM service desk to figure out how to get back home. She said that there was an announcement( in Portuguese) over the intercom. Which astonished me that they didn’t announce it in Spanish or in English considering we are flying back to the states. Once I got to the service desk (no one spoke English) I spoke to someone in Spanish to figure out how to get back home. They said they would but us up in a hotel for the 9 hour delay but when I asked how to get there he said by taxi and they would not be paying for the taxi there and back. It was then my brother and I made the decision to just stay in the airport. The gentleman then said he would give us each a food voucher which we thought was great. Little did we know, the food voucher was only worth $6.50 usd. How could we eat a meal for that much? All I was able to get was a small pox of Pringle’s and a yogurt drink. The time was already 12am and to top it off there were only two restaurants available to us in our terminal that the voucher covered and one of them was already closed. After that fiasco, we finally boarded our new flight to Lima at 3:50am. We got to Lima with no problem at 8am. Bought some breakfast there as we were starving at this point and waited for our flight to LAX which was at 12:15 pm. Once we arrived to LAX and got out of customs, we went to the baggage claim to pick up our stuff and go home. We waited there about 10 minutes till I realized there was a lady with a clipboard with my brothers name on it. It was then that she informed us our luggage had been lost in São Paulo. This was my last straw. I have been visiting my parents from college for winter break, so the only clothes I had was in that bag! She wrote a claim and told us our baggage would be delivered the next night. If we had any problems there was a number and email written that we could contact. So when last night rolled by with no call about our luggage I decided to contact them. The number lead me to where I could only leave a message (not contact an actual human) and there was no response to our email. I called the number on LATAM online page and finally get directed to someone. They inform me that there is a hold on my luggage because I didn’t complete a form! What form did I need to complete beside the claim the woman at lax helped us with! I wrote this still waiting for my bags and still I’m the same clothes from 4 days ago. Feeling disgusting. Please I advise not to fly with this company. I will definitely be spending the extra cash to fly with someone else next time.

lies about their reward program,Daniel Rowe,,LATAM Airlines,Trip Verified,"  I am incredibly disappointed with Latam’s performance and disregard for customer care before my return flight to Munich following a schedule change. After Latam informed me of a schedule change, without specifying details, I was asked to contact the operator Iberia to determine the schedule change myself. Only after confirming the schedule, I was asked to contact Latam again for the tickets to be reissued. My astonishment only grew with the attempt to shift responsibility onto another airline, the refusal to take ownership of the situation, and the request for the customer to manage affairs between Latam and Iberia. One must question the role of Latam in this situation as one expects the agent of travel, with whom the customer book the flights, to take full responsibility for liaising with the operators, confirming schedules and notifying the customers of these changes as early as possible.

ruining my vacation experience,Cindy Pellegrino,2019-12-10,LATAM Airlines,Trip Verified,"  Sydney to Brasilia via Santiago. Ground service started by making us wait in 3 different lobbies before putting us in a extremely full and hot bus that did not depart for another 30 minutes. Why did we need to move from one room to another and then wait even more on the bus? Couldn't they just make us wait the whole lot in one single place and only put us on the bus when it was ready to leave to the plane? Seats were grimy, upholstery is uncomfortably hard and - despite being a small woman, I found the seats to be very small, just as the ones in domestic flights. I found the window technology - where it's not controlled by the person seated on the window sit - very annoying. It is fine to turn it dark after providing the first meal, but not immediately. Leaving Sydney at 10am and having the windows turned dark as soon as the air plane took off was very uncomfortable and unnecessary. They should leave each person to control at least in the first 2 hours and last 2 hours of the flight, when everyone is awake. The food provided was not tasty or enough. Their tiny cheese & ham croissant with a little pot of fruits ARE NOT enough when the next meal will be in 10 hours! And when the next meal came, it was also tiny and hospital-like. They also took 1 hour (counted) to remove the trash! Making our tiny seat space even tinnier since we cannot move with a tray down. Crew on board to the flight Sydney to Chile barely spoke English and I had to talk slow and many times annoying sleeping passengers. Crew from the return flight Chile to Sydney was much better, polite and accommodating. Entertainment is extremely poor.

will not go back with them,W Karrayla,,LATAM Airlines,Trip Verified,"  I should have listened to other reviews, to avoid experience today. My flight was from Baltra to JFK with a connection in Guayaquil. The flight from Baltra to Guayaquil was delayed by 4.5 hrs due to the wind, despite 2 airlines had flew in and out an hr before and 30 mins later. The way they handled the situation was so bad. After being informed in “Spanish” that the flight was delayed, I asked if they could find alternative flights knowing i wont make it to my original flight, I was informed (multiple times by different persons) that the new flight to Guayaquil would be ok, 30 mins after landing would be fine and someone would help walk me to the plane (to make it faster). After all, it was the same airlines and other airlines had done that when the flight was delayed! To my horror, I was told when we landed in Guayaquil that sorry, nothing they could do, and that there was no communication from anyone. I asked the ground staff for the later flight, and I was ok with a connection at Miami, under American Airlines (Same partner), they said they couldnt do that, as it was delayed due to the wind, not their fault, it is too expensive for them to pay American Airlines. They offered airport hotel and issued next day economy ticket to me instead (my original business class ticket). After I asked again, they changed my ticket to business class I was brought to hotel shuttle, I asked multiple times to LATAM staff if the hotel was aware with me checking in and I was assured the hotel would give me a room as soon as I arrived and again not to worry. The meals would be covered also. Sure enough, as soon as I went to check in, the hotel staff informed me that LATAM had not approved the quote yet and I needed to wait (for god knows how long). So I asked hotel staff to come with me to the airport (again) to get this handled, when we arrived the airport, LATAM staff pretended they couldnt understand my English. Thank god I asked hotel staff to come with me to get their approval.

We were left standing at the counter while the agent talked on multiple cell phones and then left us without saying what was going on. When her supervisor eventually got into the act, she told us that we had to be re-booked for a later flight at 1:50 am, meaning that we were prisoners in the airport for about fifteen hours.

they are the worst,G Manzel,2019-11-10,LATAM Airlines,Trip Verified,"  I've been very impressed with LATAM airlines. We booked the flights on a cheapo website and had a flight cancelled a few weeks before. I sorted it out directly with Latam who were very efficient. We couldn't change the booking for the QANTAS flight back to Australia. We had carry on luggage and I was impressed that they were lenient in the weight of the luggage we brought on board. It was not excessive by any means. I saw people with some huge bags on board. Our flight from the Galapagos was delayed significantly, so they organised to put us on an Avianca flight back to ensure we made our connections. The aircraft and amenities aren't the newest, but I'm most concerned with getting to my destination. The Latam Play app is really good so its not necessary to have screens on seats.

$200 dollars for a checked bag,Theresa Conn,2019-11-09,LATAM Airlines,Not Verified,"  Boston to Punta Arenas via Santiago. Totally screwed by LATAM. I was absolutely heartbroken to cancel my solo trip to go hiking in Chile because of violence in fall 19. My hotels etc refunded me no problem, but LATAM was an absolute nightmare to deal with. Essentially, if I had flown Friday Nov 1 instead of Friday Nov 8, or if I had tickets to some soccer game on Nov 23 that had been cancelled, I could have gotten my $1300 back. Instead, I will get a standard 30% refund within 20 business days (great turnaround time!) I must have called LATAM 15 times after poor connections, being dropped from their system, etc. When I finally spoke to a supervisor, he was rude and combative. If I ever fly LATAM again, I will buy every protection that allows full refund, since they clearly have no regard for their customers safety during violent uprisings. Soccer, though, they have GREAT protections for soccer fans.",Solo Leisure,June 2019,Los Angeles to Lima,Economy Class,2.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,1,no
Seats were grimy,L Carson,2019-11-07,LATAM Airlines,Trip Verified,"  Lima to Cusco. This company is a joke. I was traveling with a group of 6 people (all U.S. Citizens). We had confirmed tickets from Lima to Cusco round trip. We arrived early at the airport just to make sure we have time in case we encounter any problems as we are in a foreign country, we preferred to take precautions just in case. Once we arrived at the counter to process our check in they told us our seats had been sold and that we had to wait for the next flight. We were very upset as we had not been notified at all of any changes regardless of the reason. They offered us a credit with the airline of $40 or a cash voucher of $20. We really didn't want either as it was cutting short our much waited vacation which we had look forward to enjoy for a year and now we are being literally forced to cut it short for $20 in exchange. Really.! Anyway, since they did not give us another option no matter how many times we said no, we took the $20 cash voucher. Here comes the worst part ... they told us that we could go to any LATAM agency and that they would exchange the voucher for cash, as the counter at the airport was not authorized to do that.  So, we went to the LATAM office in Cusco and they told us that only in Lima could be done. Upon our return to Lima we went to the LATAM agency in Chacarilla, but they told us that they couldn't do it and that we had to go to a different agency in Miraflores. We then proceeded to go to the agency in Miraflores on our last day before our departure back to the US and they proceeded to tell us that they couldn't process the request as it had to be done over the phone. It has been 5 months since that day and in the interim we have been communicating with their ""Customer Service"" department. We have been changed at least 7 times of representative and every time they ask us for passports, copies of IDs, notarized letters to approve disbursement of funds for our children voucher credit, more questions and more emails. Once we thought we finally were done, and we would finally get our credit they said they needed an account in Soles, which is the Peruvian currency. Now, why in hell would they give a voucher that specifically reads $20 (dollars) if when you redeem it you need an account in a different currency! Anyway, I was able to contact a friend in Peru that was willing to provide me with her account information for the deposit to be done in her account for her then to transfer the funds. LATAM then said that needed another letter approving such transaction, we did, we sent them once again what they requested. This was followed by a response saying that only 5 vouchers will be credited, the other one was missing a voucher number. That was 45 days ago and we still haven't received any credit. I then received an automatic email saying that if I wanted to receive the funds I had to complete their forms again because they voucher was going to expire. Then I email them again asking where my ""approved credit"" was and they ignored my question by saying please provide copy of passport, ID, notarized letter, etc etc etc etc etc. This is beyond ridiculous and a joke of customer service, I don't do all this for $20, it is a matter of principle.

But what would happen with my money? The LATAM representative said it would be back in 24 hours. It wasn't. I lodged a complaint on line heard nothing. I waited three days and then rang. Was told that it was with the right department and they would get back within six hours. They didn't.

I'll avoid flying LATAM,T Nguyen,,LATAM Airlines,Not Verified,"  Lima to Buenos Aires. The worst possible airline experience.  We had several trips booked from Australia to South America, and within South America. We arrived at the check-in desk 3 hours ahead of departure time for our flight from Lima to Buenos Aires. Were told the flight was overbooked, which took about 4 hours in total of standing at the desk waiting for ground staff to explain to us and sort out their administrative problems. Horribly slow and inefficient service, and staff were extremely unhelpful. They proposed hotel and meals for the night and $180USD travel voucher redeemable on LATAM services. Eventually we went along with their proposal and caught the flight to Buenos Aires the following day. Fast forward 10 days later .. we had a flight booked from Buenos Aires to Santiago. I unfortunately missed my flight as I was acutely unwell and taken to the Emergency Department in Buenos Aires. After my doctors consultation, we called LATAM Contact Center to notify them that my partner and I would be missing the flight due to a medical emergency and to please arrange for us another flight to Santiago, possibly the following day. They asked us to provide medical documentation, which I provided my discharge summary from the hospital and doctor’s clinical notes, signed and dated with seal. They had the audacity to say this was not enough evidence, and they could not help us because we were ‘no shows’. They said our ticket was void because was no written documentation of the flight overbooking in Lima.

Legroom was equivalent to what you'd find on a budget flight and planes were also as filthy. Meal service was pathetic. Passengers seem to carry lots of hand luggage and the ground staff seem to enforce the hand baggage rule very selectively (i.e. Foreigners get checked).

I paid with credit card, but they wanted my bank account details which I (reluctantly) gave. I have sent numerous reminders to LATAM about the outstanding refund request (with LATAM Case number) but no response.

This time around I arrive in Brasil and ask where my next boarding gate is and my other boarding pass and am told my flight was canceled then I say to the guy ""so what now?"" and he tells me I can be put on the next flight which is 13 hours from that moment meaning 8 additional hours to what I was expecting to wait. According the airline T's and C's are passengers who's flights have been canceled or have been inconvenienced in any way are to be offered refreshment and a hotel stay for a night - I was offered nothing. Then when the flight is boarding 14 hours later yes they postponed it again, I ask the LATAM agent at the gate if my return flights are still in order and he has the audacity to reply ""sorry sir I am very busy right now"" to which i am so enraged I simple walk away and have all intention of bolstering every bad thing I can scrounge about how horrible this airlines service is.

Then we arrived to Auckland and after making us wait for almost 5 hours, our flight was cancelled. Good thing they provided us accommodation but when the bus arrived to pick us up at the hotel to go to the airport, the bus was too small for all the people so we had to wait for another hour to get a new bus that drops us at the airport. We arrived to the airport and we bumped into a queue of at least 120 people. There are only 3 counters available so who knows what time we are going to be able to check in. It's 7am now, our flight is at 8:30am and we are still waiting in the queue. We have another layover in Santiago de Chile to go to Bogota, but the crew says that they cannot do anything if we miss the flight that we need to take in Santiago.

When I arrived at the designated check-in desk for the disabled at Frankfurt Airport, the check-in agent behaved rude and unprofessional. He insisted on collecting a surplus charge and tried to deny me my preassigned seat, which is unlawful. I asked repeatedly to speak to the flight manager; my request was outright denied. At this point in time, I could hardly stand any longer. The staff could not care any less.

customer service is not functioning,Derek Northcutt,2019-09-08,LATAM Airlines,Trip Verified,"  Madrid to Frankfurt. After a very positive flight from Frankfurt to Madrid, am profoundly disappointed by LATAM. Delayed my luggage three days (according to them 48 hours) and asked me to take a taxi from Osnabrück to FMO airport because they do not have an arrangement with Lufthansa for baggage delivery. The cost of a round-trip taxi is 175€. I tried to mitigate the cost by renting a car for the weekend (it's 64€ v. renting a car for three hours is 20€ more) and parked the car in my driveway for the weekend. I saved LATAM 111€ yet they offered me only 18€ for the car hire even though they'd agreed to pay for my round trip taxi (the funny thing is that I spoke to a Lufthansa Mitarbeiterin at FMO and she told me that if LATAM had simply asked them to deliver the suitcase - as is normal procedure with delayed baggage across the industry -- they would've made the arrangements and would've invoiced LATAM the cost. I told LATAM that if they are going to land in Germany and delay their customer's baggage they'd better come to an agreement with the German carriers to delivery their misdirected luggage). My ex-husband had convinced me that LATAM has ripped me off and it is better for my mental health to let go of it but I am having second thoughts about filing a court action against them. Until they are corrected, they will continue to mistreat the traveling public.

The meal itself though was the worst I have ever had on an airline. White rice with a few diced tomato pieces and grilled zucchini. Absolutely flavorless, dry, and zucchini tasted of plastic.

But the male call-center staff intentionally hung up the phone four times while having conversation. We couldn't help paying the money otherwise we would have missed our flight this morning. We were very disappointed with the staff & their services & the call guy's attitude. I think that Latam airline has been cheating on people like this. They display their tickets ""including one baggage"" on the website and then when people actually get to the check-in counter they say that you have to pay for your luggage.

Very uncomfortable seats,Derek Northcutt,2019-08-06,LATAM Airlines,Trip Verified,"  Was pleased with this company: upgrade from Frankfurt to Madrid and was admitted to the AC Maple Leaf Lounge - not a very nice club but a nice gesture. Catering and service aboard the flight was excellent, however I do not understand how a new airplane - Boeing 787 - has seats that do not function. My first seat in row 1 had a faulty entertainment system, so I gathered my things and moved to row 3 -- there, the seat did not recline or move at all. I declined to move a third time. Return flight not so good. The agent at the priority check-in (am AA Platinum) insisted that I pay 10€ to have my suitcase wrapped in plastic b/c there was an exposed edge on my suitcase and he said it would damage other suitcases in the hold (a first for me after 40 years of flying). I waited 75"" at Frankfurt Airport and no suitcase. There was another suitcase similarly wrapped in the claim area and the agent thinks that mine had been taken home in error. By the time i'd made the report (I'd warned that agent after 75"" of waiting that I had a train to catch) I rushed to the Fernbahnhof but missed my train, and so had to grapple with the Deutsche Bahn staff to be put on the next train which had me home three hours late. I tried to access the Latam site as quoted on the claim receipt (LATAM.com/BAGAGEM) but that page doesn't exist. Called the phone number on the receipt but the recorded message told me to go to the airline's webpage (now that's certainly not getting anywhere). So, I am here in Osnabrück for my ex-husband's 60th birthday party (a formal catered affair at a fancy hotel) with nothing to wear and what's worse is that my medicine is in the suitcase.

good flight experience,S Dale,2019-07-26,LATAM Airlines,Trip Verified,"  Had a connection in Miami after flying from NYC LGA. I booked my tickets through American Airlines because Latam is a partner. I printed my boarding passes off the American website. My flight to Miami went fine. We had a 1.75 hour ground time to connect. We landed in Terminal D and our Latam flight departed in Terminal H. We gave ourselves 30 minutes to walk from Terminal D to H. We went through the TSA precheck line and when they scanned our boarding passes the boarding passes were rejected. Security told us we had to go back to Terminal D for American to print out our boarding passes. Our Latam flight was departing at 5:24 and it is now 4:50. So we ran to Terminal D and after talking to an American agent we were told that they could not print our boarding passes because the flight was on Latam and that we needed to go to Latam in Terminal J to get our boarding passes. We ran to Terminal J and it is now 5:15. We scanned our documents at the kiosk that told us the flight was closed. We spoke to a Latam ground agent who understood the problem. She walked us to a ticket counter and, in Spanish, explained the problem. It was now 5:20. The ticket agent printed out our boarding passes, walked us to the security, had security rush us through and we ran to the gate for our flight arriving at 5:24. The gate agents asked for our passports and waved us through. The aircraft crew was very accommodating in helping us store our luggage, escorting us to our seats and providing beverages to cool us down. The flight departed on time and the flight to Lima as very pleasant after such an awful experience on the ground. If it has not been for the ground and gate staff we would never had made the flight.

Avoid this airline,S Dale,2019-07-25,LATAM Airlines,Trip Verified,"  Had the 12:15 a.m. non-stop flight. Check in and baggage drop was very efficient. We boarded on time and departed Lima on schedule. The announcements in English were very clear and thorough. There was plenty of overhead space and crew was very accommodating in helping passengers lift their luggage. Our flight departed on-time. The onboard entertainment system has many offerings and easy to navigate. Seats comfortable with plenty of legroom. I am 6'1"" and was comfortable. They provided blankets, pillows and headsets. Beverage service provided shortly after reaching cruising altitude. And food service came shortly afterwards. The flight was smooth and pleasant. I read many not-so-positive reviews of Latam before booking through American Airlines. I was pleasantly surprised by the courtesy of the crew, the amenities provided, the entertainment choices, the comfort of the seats, the cleanliness of the toilets and the overall experience.

I wish I would’ve known I couldn’t carry water on the plane, even though it was purchased at the airport. The flight attendants were were friendly, accommodating and respectful.

said I had to pay $50 for my baggage,Zachary Meistre,2019-07-18,LATAM Airlines,Not Verified," Johannesburg to Lima via Sao Paulo. Checked in at O.R Tambo and was told that they were unable to print my second boarding pass and said to ask for it at LATAM in Sao Paulo. Got to Sao Paulo and went straight to LATAM - the flight was canceled and I was in no way forewarned, my layover was pushed from 5 hours to 6 additional hours and then it got pushed by an additional 3 hours - a 14-hour wait. None the less I arrived in Lima (which is my second home country) many hours later than previously planned. I have never experienced bad service from LATAM ever, and now I got this! When I went to LATAM in Sao Paulo they didn't even offer any hospitality for rest nor did they provide any eats or beverages. Jeepers creepers did this tick me off to high heaven. Then about 40 minutes before the flight started boarding I wanted to make sure the return LATAM flight was not canceled and the gentleman attending to me had the audacity to tell me "" Sir I can't help you right now I am busy"". How hard is it for an airline that factually rakes in millions of USD per month to show a little decency? I will be contacting them within the next few days to see how my refund is coming along. I am a frequent flyer and this was the worst I have ever experienced and to be honest, I was very fond of LATAM, it was my wife and my preferred airline.",Solo Leisure,July 2019,Ushuaia to Buenos Aires,Economy Class,2.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,1,no

this flight really disappointed,Evangelos Mitsokapas,2019-07-17,LATAM Airlines,Not Verified,"  Montevideo to Cusco via Lima. Staff were sort of kind but of course, there is always a priority to people who speak Spanish. If you do not speak Spanish you have to wait. Also, due to a delay I lost my connection and the staff kindly informed me that they cannot contact their colleagues at Lima to give me another flight and I would only know whether I make it or not once I arrive in Lima. What an adventure. Delay was due to the weather but people come on, you could have provided a meal to all of the passengers here. Also, what is with all the secrecy about flight connections?

Was pleased with this company,Karen Lee,2019-07-17,LATAM Airlines,Trip Verified,"  Ushuaia to Buenos Aires. I purchased two tickets on LATAM Airline for an April 30, 2019 flight. The flight was canceled because of a national transportation strike. I was promised a refund for my two tickets within 20 business days. At the end of that time, I called and a ticket was submitted on my behalf (their procedure) to find out why I hadn't received my refund. They said it would be 10 more business days. At the end of 10 business days, I called back and they told me all they could do was submit another ticket. I went on their social media page and complained and they told me they were submitting another ticket. It has now been 77 days and I have nothing but empty promises. I have also had the misfortune of reading many other people's stories who have been waiting longer than I have, some more than six months with the same formula, the refund is ""in process."" Ironically, the canceled flight to Buenos Aires caused me to miss a connecting flight to Santiago, Chile via Sky Airline. They refunded my money for that flight!!

only positive things to say,C Branson,2019-07-14,LATAM Airlines,Not Verified,"  Melbourne to Bogota via Santiago. We had purchased our tickets six months prior to flying. The flights were selected for best time of departing, and shortest length travelling time. Departing Melbourne at 8 pm. At some point during the interim, LATAM rescheduled this flight, and the return flight, allocating us completely different Itineraries. However, they did not, at any time, contact us to inform us of the rescheduled flights, or changed return itinerary. The only way we found out was an email sent the night before, informing us that the flight was delayed a few hours. Instead of leaving at scheduled time of 12.45pm, it would be leaving a couple of hours later. This was the first time we had received any idea that the departure time had been rescheduled from 8pm to 12.45pm. I rang LATAM immediately after checking our booking, having found it different to the flights I had booked. The outward bound journey had us in Santiago for ten hours; the return flight, in particular, was a dog’s breakfast that had us making three stops on the way home, over several days, and then stranded in Sydney. LATAM were able to change the itinerary for the homeward flight, after a lot of explaining and complaining on our part, but have refused to apologise or acknowledge any wrongdoing at all. We will never book flights with LATAM again. Their customer service is hopeless. They have no accountability or responsibility or care. All it needed was one email to ticket holders when they decided to change the flight several months after we booked. The distress we experienced over this was enormous; if the flight had not been delayed, we would have been none the wiser, and we would have turned up for our 8 pm flight, only to find it had already gone. We had visits organised on our way to the airport, to visit family and grandchildren before going away for five weeks. We had to cancel these, which caused stress and upset to everyone.

This was the most horrible customer service experience (with LATAM) I ever had in my entire 58 years of life. I have been a devoted American Airlines customer (a member of the 1 million miles “club”), and thought LATAM would be the same level of services. From this experience, I will never call, set foot, or fly LATAM for the rest of my life; and, will make sure my family, friends, and business relationships I have do the same. LATAM never more.

most wonderful experience,J Carter,2019-06-29,LATAM Airlines,Not Verified,"  Disgusted with the horrible experience with Latam, would never recommend. We were on a connecting flight using the same airline we’re the first flight was all on time. Upon running through the airport to try and board out next flight they would not let us on the plane (which had 30mins till take off). When asked why we can’t board the staff said “It is our policy that passengers cannot board the plane without their baggage also in the plane and our baggage supposedly had not been loaded onto the plane. However, we later found out all baggage on connecting flights gets loaded directly onto the next plane no matter the circumstances, and our baggage had left. We were left for an extra 24hrs with no clothes, toiletries or anything as well as lost wages from work we planned on attending. In return for the inconveniences we received absolutely nothing. Not even when we repeatedly tried for something as a seat upgrade. ",Family Leisure,June 2019,Johannesburg to Buenos Aires via Sao Paulo,Economy Class,1.0,1.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,1,no
flight was canceled,William Adair,2019-06-28,LATAM Airlines,Trip Verified,"  We flew from Madrid to Frankfurt on Latam. I cannot praise this airline enough. The crew were attentive with a warm and genuinely friendly demeanour. We boarded on time and were lead to our, two abreast, seats in the middle of the aircraft. Upon taking our seats we were offered Champagne or water and a bowl of nuts to nibble. The seats were similar in layout and operation to other airlines such as LOT and offered the option of a full recline into a fully flat bed. The pitch was more than adequate. The TV was operated either by a handheld controller or by touch screen. The selection seemed fine (although I didn't take advantage of it, my wife managed a movie). We were taken back onto stand because of a late slot amendment owing to weather at Frankfurt. This delay was minimal however it did allow the cabin crew time to ply me with another cold Champagne (as a former Air Traffic Controller I abhor delays, however with Champagne, not so much). A short taxi and departure from one of the southeasterly runways and we were up. The lunch service started soon after take off. The food was very pleasant. A nice shrimp salad with a curried mayonnaise served with a fruit bowl and cheese course. It was washed down with a few glasses of very tasty Chilean white wine. Coffee was served in a large cup! Thank you for that, (I hate teeny tiny cups of coffee) and more wine or cold drinks were offered. I took advantage of stretching out and woke up on descent into Frankfurt. The whole trip was just over two and a half hours. I cannot recommend LATAM high enough.",Couple Leisure,June 2019,Easter Island to Santiago,Business Class,4.0,2.0,3.0,5.0,2.0,10,yes

I booked 2 flights to go to 2 different cities. I missed my first flight. The agent told me that I could take the following flight if I pay 155USD with him over the phone. He said my credit card wont work (although it was perfectly working and my bank confirmed no purchase tentative has been made). The agent told me to go to the airport and I could pay There. I showed up to the airport and the agent told me the flight is overbooked. I spoke to 3 different agents to confirm that if I manage to go to the other city I could take my second flight free of charge. I asked them to send me a confirmation email they said no need and gave their name as a reference.

secrecy about flight connections,A Mayri,2019-06-09,LATAM Airlines,Trip Verified,"  Johannesburg to Buenos Aires via Sao Paulo. Disregarding the fact that just about all of our routes were delayed, our luggage was mishandled and lost en route to Buenos Aires. Although the wait was quite long reporting the luggage hadn’t been received at the airport, the ground staff were quite helpful. We received an allowance for the day which would have been fine if it wasn’t for one of the large denomination notes being an unusable counterfeit. We’re a family of four, traveling with a one year old and a four year old, none of our checked in luggage made it to our destination. In fact, it took three days for us to be re-united (fortunately) with our luggage. Having travelled extensively, I’m aware that airlines allow for compensation to travellers who purchase essentials (Clothes and cosmetics), should luggage be delayed or lost. I made sure I retained all slips of such items purchased. All seemed fine and my claim for this compensation was lodged in mid January 2019, not an insignificant amount given this was for the whole family for three days without any of our luggage. In the months since then, I have experienced nothing short of #incompetence, neglect, lies and deception from LATAM Airlines. It took a month before a formal letter for settlement for the claim was received, which was laughable in its value in relation to my expense which was well within the Montreal Convention provisions. The staff handling the case were so disorganised, they misplaced the proofs provided. After several promised deadlines were missed I then received a reasonable settlement letter which was signed and I was advised that payment will be fulfilled within 20 days. This after queries from staff suggested they had no clue on how to actually fulfil an international funds transfer. Unsurprisingly, a full month later (End March 2019), no payment was received. It took another month until early May for the airline to acknowledge an apparent system issue and advise that payment will reflect in a further 20 days. Don’t bother trying to get any information from their call centre, they are so clueless and disempowered, it actually got to a stage where the agent I was talking to could not help me or put a supervisor / manager on the phone. There was no further course of escalation, only a “note” on the system for the relevant department to contact me, which they never did, for weeks! No prizes, for guessing, the second official settlement advice and a further 20 day period elapsed with no payment received. We are now in June 2019, almost six months after the claim and more than three months after a legally binding settlement letter was received and agreed. What a shameful disgrace of an organisation. In an industry where efficiency and Customer Service are paramount it is a surprise that LATAM has survived.

would never recommend,D Munsen,2019-05-17,LATAM Airlines,Trip Verified,"  Yesterday, I was going to fly from Boston to Sao Paulo on Latam. The flight was leaving at 5:30 PM and I used the Logan Express bus from Braintree leaving there at 2:40 PM. It is only 10 miles to Logan, but I did not arrive at the airport until 4:45 PM. There was no one at the counters, so I called the ""customer service"" number to explain. There were 5 other passengers who also  arrived late. Customer service took 45 minutes to see what they could do for me. The flight the next day did have space. And to change the ticket to the next day would cost $7,910. Considering my ticket cost $1,600.00 I thought this was a mistake. No mistake. I opted for not flying with Latam the next day. Will apply the $1,600 paid for the ticket to another flight on them in the future. It is unfortunate they do not have someone at the airport to speak with directly. This was my first experience missing a flight. I thought there would be a better plan in place for this situation. How many people would pay or could pay an additional $7,910 for arriving 15 minutes late. The solution for me was to call American Airlines and they were able to get me on a flight 2 days later for a reasonable cost.

Flight delayed 4 hours then cancelled at 2am in the morning with little to no explanation or concern. Forced to get up at 6am only to be told we would not be on another flight until 17 hours later. Missed international connecting flights with an English speaking attendant ignoring us and saying she does not understand English. A further 2 hours to check back in. Was then given a travel voucher only for all three of our party to be missing the last number on the printed travel voucher. Once back home in Australia we tried to claim expense of the voucher with incompetent staff who would pause and not answer a question that was asked for minutes at a time. Finally after much heartache was told the transfer was complete and would take no longer than 15 working days to show up in account, never showed up. Called/emailed multiple times to follow up only to get transferred to an alternative team member and told my case was still getting resolved. 4 months later no money has been transferred.

Easily the worst airline I've ever experienced (as an American, that is saying a lot, given the terrible airlines we have in the USA). The female agent and her male supervisor at Ushuaia on the early afternoon of March 23 forced us to check in all of our carry-on luggage based on balancing ""weight"" on overhead compartments-- on an A321. (By the way, this was the first time this has ever happened, including other Latam flights). They forced my wife to move over when she was repacking her suitcase to accommodate another passenger (the other passenger, a typically kind Argentine, was the one who apologized to my wife - not a Latam employee). The ride was atrocious - no food available apart from a flimsy bag of dry crackers, flight attendants who literally heated full meals while in-flight for themselves while the entire cabin was in the middle of a 3.5-hour ride starving, and the flight attendants were basically not doing anything.

THE BEST AIRLINE CABIN CREW,Angel Rodriguez,,LATAM Airlines,Trip Verified,"  Madrid to Santiago de Chile. My experience is bad. Latam has had a decline over time.  Flight of 13 hours is made long since starting the service on board is scarce, the food is little considering the hours of travel, it is of good quality but scarce. The entertainment is good, The plane is clean. Unfortunately one of my suitcases did not arrive in Santiago de Chile and it took a week to arrive, and when I arrived was broken, without wheels and items missing. I think the quality of LATAM has declined over time.  ES: Mi experiencia es mala. Latam ha tenido un declive con el tiempo. El vuelo de 13 horas se hace largo ya que comenzando el servicio a bordo es escaso, la comida es poca considerando las horas de viaje, es de buena calidad pero escasa. El entretenimiento es bueno, El avión está limpio. Desafortunadamente una de mis maletas no llegó a santiago de chile y se demoró 1 semana en llegar, y al llegar estaba rota, sin ruedas y me habian violado el sello y me robaron pertenencias de la maleta.

missed = meal as I was sleeping,H Varter,2019-03-17,LATAM Airlines,Trip Verified,"  London to Sao Paulo. We booked a holiday to Buenos Aires and Rio using Latam flying business class. The flight out was satisfactory but returning home was a nightmare. Although our seats had been booked and paid for months before, we were told that my wife and I could not sit together. Prior to this, the check in female had been asked if there was a problem and we were told NO. When we stated that this was not acceptable we were dismissed with a take it or leave attitude and told that the seating would be sorted out at another Latam desk. This continued until we were at the boarding gate where we were assured that the seats would be together and return in 30 minutes to find out. On return nothing had been sorted and we were told to board the plane and stand by the seats we should have had. A member of the cabin crew approached us and said that she had found two seats together in another part of the plane. All along the line from one desk to another we were dismissed and lied to making us out to be the trouble makers. Making matters worse was the fact that the seat which we had booked months ago was given to another passenger who only booked it 3 hours before departure and he was prepared to move but was told he could not by the cabin crew! Do not expect to get what you paid for or have any help from any Latam airline staff. If there is an alternative airline, travel with them. Our travel agent complained on our behalf as did the two reps we had on the holiday and it has taken from November to March to get nowhere with them. No communication, explanation or response.

not be using LATAM again,Erica Reichlin,2019-03-05,LATAM Airlines,Trip Verified,"  While the flight itself and the staff onboard was a pleasant experience, the after was not. LATAM lost my luggage without any knowledge of where it could be. For over 25 hours. I have not seen my family in Peru for well over 5 years, so now I must waste time to purchase clothing, sundries and medicine for myself and daughter because we were to be 250 miles away for vacation with all my family. Not only did they not know, they never offered a voucher, they single handedly ruined my family's time as well as cause misery and needless stress. When they finally found my luggage, it was way after we had already left for another destination, money wasted on new items and LATAM after numerous attempts for reimbursement, offers (after a week of contact) a 25 dollar voucher to be used towards a flight. Clothing in Peru is American pricing and that is the best LATAM could do? Because of them, I didn't have access to mine and my 5 year old daughters luggage for 3 more days, plus all the money and time spent on trying to reconcile this whole disaster that they more or less were trying to place blame of on us. Their customer service is the absolute worst. To make matters even worse, when we went to take a return flight, we were ""chosen"" for a random search because we complained, they took brand new unopened water bottles saying that American flights don't allow drinks purchased in airport and tossed them, wasting more money. If you ever have a problem with LATAM, you are completely out of luck trying to get matters rectified.

Easily the worst airline ,D Fargen,,LATAM Airlines,Trip Verified,"  Frankfurt to Sao Paulo. I lost my ground connection due to an operational issue.

quality of LATAM is low,Anael Gadrat,2019-02-28,LATAM Airlines,Trip Verified,"  We could not take our flight between Sao Paulo and Madrid because our seats were already occupied (LATAM has overbooked). We had to wait 2 hours to be told that we would be transferred to the hotel and that Latam would contact us the next day to offer us new flights (our final destination being Paris). Without news of Latam, we decide to return to the Sao Paulo airport on our own (their voucher does not work with taxis). We learn there that they repositioned us on a flight 2 days later. They are told that it is not possible and that one needs to be in Paris the next day (February 28th). After 5 hours of negotiations, we finally managed to have a flight to Rome. Arriving in Rome we learn that Latam made a date error (March 28 instead of February 28) for our flight Rome Paris she booked with Air France. Apart from low cost, I have never had such a negative experience with a company. Especially since the vast majority of staff do not speak English.  FR: Nous n'avons pas pu prendre notre vol entre Sao Paulo et Madrid car nos sièges étaient déjà occupés (la TAM a pratiqué le surbooking). Nous avons du attendre 2 heures pour que l'on nous explique que nous serions transférés à l'hôtel et que Latam nous contacterait le lendemain pour nous proposer de nouveaux vols (notre destination final étant Paris). Sans nouvelle de Latam, nous décidons de retourner à l'aéroport de Sao Paulo par nos propres moyens (leur voucher ne marchant pas avec les taxis). On apprend là bas qu'ils nous ont repositionner sur un vol 2 jours après. On leur explique que ce n'est pas possible et que l'on a besoin d'être à Paris le lendemain (28 février). Après 5 heures de négociations, on réussi enfin à avoir un vol en direction de Rome. Arrivée à Rome nous apprenons que Latam a fait une erreur de date (28 mars au lieu du 28 février) pour notre vol Rome Paris qu'elle a réservé auprès d'Air France.

LATAM has declined,Hayley Brown,2019-01-27,LATAM Airlines,Trip Verified,"  Lima to Los Angeles. I have a family of 6, 2 adults, 4 kids returning home on Latam from a holiday in Peru. We checked into our international flight as instructed 3 hours before the departure at the airport as we were unable to check in online before. As we were at the airport arriving from Cuzco the night before, the local agent said simply getting to the airport early and 3 hours before departure would ensure the ability to check in at the airport Kiosk. We had prepaid tickets and seat assignments. Upon check in at the airport in Lima early, 8:30 for our noon departure, we were told there were no seats for our 3 kids as the flight was oversold and my kids were bumped off the flight. They assured us that they would attempt to get volunteers off the flight to accommodate my kids. We spent 3 hours at the gate very stressed and upset. Luckily 2 seats became available. The flight began boarding and we were still waiting as they said the last seat for my son would become available. At this point the flight was boarded and they told us to board. 5 of us went through the gate onto the plane and then they stopped my son and said he had no seat. They closed the gate and left him there! He is 18 but regardless this was unbelievable! I have never heard of an airline breaking up a family and leaving a family member alone in a foreign country. I cried the whole way home. They promised my son $300, but he had to fight to get $200 for spending money. They got him a hotel room and he had to leave back to the US the next day.  My travel agent and myself have tried to get through to the airlines about this situation, but they are indifferent and really don't care. Clearly this company is driven by greed and obviously resold our tickets to other passengers at a higher fee. We have traveled all over the world and have used airlines in all different countries but have never experienced such treatment in our lives. It is disgusting and I will never fly this airline again and would advise anyone considering flying Latam to consider any other option. We used them domestically as well and every flight was a disaster. ",Family Leisure,December 2018,New York to Porto Alegre via Sao Paolo,Economy Class,2.0,1.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,1,no
a low cost airline,Albert Vasquez,2019-01-14,LATAM Airlines,Not Verified,"  Sydney to Santiago de Chile. My experience with this airline and on this flight was quite bland. On a Qantas ticket, i waited 80mins in line to check in, as QF pax can not check in online and have to queue. They has 3 agents for bag drop ( which we couldn't use) and 2 for check-in. I have not waited that length of time since the early 90s. Completely poor thought process at YSSY. The agent alluded to it being due to Christmas; oddly enough it was the same flight and number of pax everyday. They hadn't added anymore seats or a bigger aircraft. It was a seat, some food and an uncomfortable chair. Service was efficient to the point that they did there job but there was no obvious pride in their role / job / service. Cabin crew were young, not particularly friendly and made pax feel as if they were truly on an airbus. Smiles were non existent somewhat millenial in their attitude. Meal service / selections were minimal and portions, just enough to hold you down. Normally for breakfast you get the option of a hot meal with a fruit salad and yoghurt; our option was fruit salad or yoghurt as an example of how frugal the airline was. I did not see cabin crew offer water in the cabin and needed to go to the galley to get a drink and when i asked for more than a cup, felt as though i had inconvenienced the cabin crew. The best thing about the flight was the aircraft; quiet, hydrated and comfortable. Not so the chair. Sadly with only Qantas providing competition, i would consider flying them again but would come on board more prepared with food and water.

appalling customer service,Keith Lovering,2019-01-14,LATAM Airlines,Trip Verified,"  London to Goiania via San Paulo. I purchased the flight as I was travelling with two young children and the 15 hours flight time was better than the other airlines. I never expected  that when you arrive in San Paulo you have to collect your luggage for the connecting flight (Also Latam) and go through immigration and customs before waiting in a massive queue to check into the domestic flight to Goiania, as you only have less that two hours to connect this is an impossible situation, and the check in staff admitted no one makes the published flight. So what was a 15 hour flight with connections ended up as a 25 hour flight. As far as I can see this breaks the advertising rules for one and is also a con by the airline to make it look good to the competition.",Family Leisure,January 2019,Sydney to Santiago,Economy Class,1.0,1.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,3,no
LATAM Airlines customer review,Fedah Mohammed,2019-01-11,LATAM Airlines,Not Verified,"  New York to Porto Alegre via Sao Paolo. I have no complaints for the service on the plane, but I will never fly with LATAM again. The customer service with the airline at the airport is horrible and you'll find yourself pulling teeth trying to figure out what exactly is going on. Everybody gives you a different answer for questions you have regarding your flights and it's extremely frustrating trying to deal with those who work for the airline (again, not as flight attendants but airport workers). On the way to Porto Alegre from JFK, I had a connecting flight in Sao Paolo. Since it was international to domestic, we had to pick up our bags and transfer them to the correct terminal. My sister checked her bag in and never saw it again since the woman working there sent it to a completely different city in Brazil. The entire time, my sister received no word on her bag and it wasn't until we got back to JFK in NY that we realized they found the bag in Sao Paolo (since it got sent back). This didn't matter though since when we got to JFK, 4 more bags were missing and we had no idea where they were. We were traveling with nine checked in bags and only received five when we got back to New York. Two of the bags missing were mine and I went home with absolutely no clothes, shoes, or gifts. After traveling 14 hours, this was rather frustrating and the response from LATAM employees at the airport was even more frustrating. They said how they didn't know how it happened and that sometimes security kept the bags extra to check them before sending them on the plane. I didn't think this made sense since five of the nine bags had been sent. They told us they'd ""try their best"" to find them and to keep our phones nearby just in case they found them on the next flight. It was just ridiculous that not one, but 5 bags had been lost during our experience with LATAM. Needless to say, this was the last time I would be flying with LATAM and I will makes sure to look into any other airline I use before flying with them.

service the absolute worst,Kevin Sands,2018-12-14,LATAM Airlines,Not Verified,"  Sao Paulo to Auckland via Santiago. I purchased a 3-leg ticket through eDreams. A few weeks later I was informed that LATAM had brought forward the 2nd leg by 35 mins. This created a layover between the 1st and 2nd legs of 70 mins. The minimun allowed is 75 mins. When this was brought to LATAM's attention the changed the 2nd flight to a later departing flight. A few weeks later this flight was cancelled. Back to the original problem! I phoned LATAM Help Center. The agent said that the minimum time between domestic and international flights at GRU was 60 mins - no problem. Great! But my Online Travel Agent said no. So I phoned LATAM again. This time an agent told me, at first 60 mins but then went away and came back and said 75 mins. He then told me to contact the airline supplying the 1st leg - Avianca - because they held the ticket. I asked if I could have a refund or change the date, no! I asked to speak to a supervisor, no.

We had a connection flight from Sao Paulo to Rio and when the flight was delayed at Sao Paulo we missed our flight to Rio and LATAM made us stand at the airport for more than 3 hours. No one can speak English and when I got a hold of the Supervisor she stood with staff joking around laughing knowing that I was waiting for her. She was very unprofessional in her approach in how she dealt with everything, they then had to book us in to a hotel for the evening, and they booked a Hotel that was almost 2 hours away from the airport. The air hostesses were very unfriendly, when you asked them for something they give you this look of what now. We had a travel agent book this flight, will definitely advise them not to book this airline for future customers. Another thing, they only serve you dinner at 6.30 and then you don't see the airhostesses for the whole evening, only in the morning.

never experienced such treatment,C Yeoh,,LATAM Airlines,Not Verified,"  Our Santiago-Sao Paolo flight on LATAM Airlines on 7 April 2018 was delayed and we missed our connection to Johannesburg. We spent a total of 7 hours at GRU airport to sort things out and were stranded in GRU for 2 days. To make matters worse, we were denied boarding by LATAM on our rescheduled flight because we needed yellow fever jab for South Africa. Another 7 hours at GRU. Flights were full and we had no choice but to fly business on Emirates to Dubai to catch our connecting to Kuala Lumpur. There was no help from LATAM and at huge expense to us, besides the inconvenience, unnecessary hassle and loss of precious time. We submitted our claim  with complete documentation, for reimbursement of expenses incurred.

ended up as a 25 hour flight,S Garmina,2018-11-27,LATAM Airlines,Trip Verified,"  Sydney to Rio de Janeiro via Santiago. I've just purchased 13 tickets through the Black Friday sales, trying to organise this big group to go to Brazil next year for my wedding. I purchased 3 individual tickets separately (different itinerary), then 7 tickets at the same time and 3 people opted to do the transaction using their own credit cards. As soon as the purchase of the 7 tickets was confirmed, the price for the inbound flight went from A$686 to A$1140, although this was still Sunday, the 25th November, still within the Black Friday period promising the discounts. So we were forced to buy the 3 remainder tickets with the inbound flight on the next day (7 July). This morning I checked, and the flights on the 6 July were again down to A$686!!! I called and explained the situation but there is no way they could change the flights to the day before free of charge. I then tried again willing to pay the A$100 fee to get a refund (it was a 'plus' ticket and this is in the policy). It turns out the 'plus' doesn't apply because the outbound flight was a 'light' fare, in which case the whole trip becomes 'light' (so why are they allowed to sell it in the first place???). This Black Friday is the biggest scam I've ever seen because the increase the prices the day before and then apply the discount on the increase prices, so the discount is not the percentage promised anyway.

never fly with LATAM again,H Mantera,2018-11-16,LATAM Airlines,Trip Verified,"  Los Angeles to Santiago de Chile. I brought my ticket with miles through the frequent flyer program. I attempted to change the date for the outbound flight a week prior to the intended date. I called on 2 consecutive dates: Day 1, after being on the phone for over 1hour they couldn't help me because the system was not working. Day 2, after they were about to finalize my transaction and waiting 1hr 10min the call dropped. I waited for a call back for 40 min. Called back, after being on the phone for another 40min, they let me know that the price in miles is no longer the one arranged, and is now over 300,000 miles (5x the price arranged). I asked for a supervisor, he said they are not available. I asked how many were on staff, he said 2. This transaction was such a waste of my time and their time. They never attempted to call me back after the calls dropped, the price changed in a matter of minutes and they were not able to honor the offer.

seating top notch,E Smith,2018-11-13,LATAM Airlines,Not Verified,"  I flew from Adelaide to Lima. On the way to Peru, I had no complaints regarding the company, they were fine. The day prior to leaving the country, I was in Cusco and checked into the flight (Lima to Santiago) and received a boarding pass with a specific seat number on this particular plane. I arrived at 10.30pm to check-in for my 2am flight in Lima the following morning only to be told that I no longer had a seat on the flight although I had a boarding pass with a seat number. I asked them how this was possible and they initially blamed my travel agent. When this was further questioned, the lady behind the desk then told me that there was a last minute change of plane and it is now smaller. I was extremely disappointed as this meant that O would miss 2 connecting flights and not be able to leave until 1pm the next day. The offered me a night in a hotel and transport, however, this doesn't change the fact that I was extremely inconvenienced.

They left our bags in Brazil and took 6 days to get them to Santiago. They wouldn’t allow us to make a claim for reimbursement until the bags had been lost for over 24 hours. On the way back, we bought a jar of honey inside the airport (post security) and they wouldn’t let us bring it in the plane claiming that the shop was not duty free and the airline would not allow for ""liquids"" of over x ounces from non-duty free shops. This was all post decided by the attendants that were checking hand luggage while boarding (at the gate). They said we could go back to the store and try to get our money back, but we could lose the flight if we weren’t back on time. The 4 hour flight from Brazil also had no working entertainment.

Prior that, I phoned (two months ago or so) to claim these same miles, I was told that they were 'getting transferred' that never happened.

At the counter, even though I fully and precisely informed the agent of my final destination, she did not book me all the way through and at the gate the LATAM agents kept us barricaded off till boarding time and allowed no time or opportunity to ask them questions.

I then held up cash and yelled to anyone in line heading to Guayaquil I am willing to pay for their seat. I thankfully had a taker.

wasted my time and money,Mauricio Canosa,,LATAM Airlines,Trip Verified,"  Sao Paulo to Paris. I decided to give LATAM a second chance after a bad experience between Sao Paulo and Frankfurt two years ago. After all, they have new A350s to Paris, with their ""new"" Premium Business cabin and service. Check-in at the GRU was fast and efficient, but the Business class boarding pass was a piece of paper similar to a fast-food ticket. I was directed to a beautiful but crowded lounge with good little bites and drinks options. This time, getting on board was on time, and I found the wide cabin looking nice in the mood lighting and properly cleaned. A undrinkable ""welcome"" Chilean sparkling was served and the crew distributed menus and small amenity kit. Unfortunately, double seats (2-2-2 configuration) are not private at all and I had a very annoying passenger sitting next to me and complaining loudly about the poor food and service throughout the dinner time. I cannot blame him as the food was of very bad quality as well as the wines, certainly not suitable for a Premium Business class or even an international economy class. With everything in a little tray, which was dirty and well used with lots of cracks and tears, they served a choice between a simple salad or small soup, a hard loaf from the basket, the main course of braised beef with vegetables and a slice of canned pineapple. From the wine list of 3 red wines, 1 Argentinian and 2 Chilean, only one of the Chileans was available, a cheap and inedible, acid one. The two flight attendants were polite but unable to attend the full cabin of 30 passengers in a timely manner, and while they were trying to hurry, they often forgot items such as drinks, water, bread or jumping a few seats which left some passengers really upset. It was impossible to get a second round of water, (hard) bread or drinks, but for the low quality wine, I did not complain. After dinner, toilets were already so dirty with water on the floor and other debris, very disgusting, but deteriorated even more during the flight. For entertainment, no wifi, and the system loaded with some movies and music had to be restarted 3 or 4 times due to a malfunction. At least the seat was flat and the A350 is a wide aircraft with large windows and high ceiling and I was able to sleep for a few hours. In the morning, a terrible breakfast was served with a dry and tasteless omelette, a hard bread but okay small slices of fruit and coffee. Although it is a flight of almost 12 hours, no snacks were available or any kind of service provided during mid flight. Fortunately, the flight arrived on time and I was able to quickly connect with Aeroflot for a shorter flight but for a much better experience. I travel twice a year between Sao Paulo and Europe and use different airlines. There is no reason to travel with LATAM if you can choose Air France, Iberia, Lufthansa, Tap or Swiss for the same fare.",Solo Leisure,October 2018,Lima to Miami,Business Class,1.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,3,no

never fly with them again,S Mcain,2018-10-20,LATAM Airlines,Trip Verified,"  Worst airline experience ever. I had 6 flights total, and only the very last flight was supposed to be with another airline. First my first flight to my destination was delayed an hour, which would have caused me to miss my connecting flight. I did luckily at that point have a super lady assist with fixing that. Then I find out on my trip that my two return flights with them were changed and literally all over the place. My first flight was now taking off when my last flight was supposed to and my middle flight was going in the opposite direction. I had to have my father call on my behalf, who was on the phone with them for roughly 3 hours trying to fix this and get me on the appropriate flights, which apparently would have cost over $2000 CAD, even though online told a much different story, but it doesn’t seem like they were willing to fix their mistakes. So I had to accept the only free flight change they were willing to offer me, which really wasn’t free since I needed an extra night at the hotel, and one layover went from 2 hours to 7 hours. This also required me cancelling an appointment that was made two months prior and now rescheduled in another month and a half.

not recommend this airline,Kezia Mcclelland,2018-10-12,LATAM Airlines,Trip Verified,"  Calama to Buenos Aires via Santiago. I would strongly recommend that you never use this airline. We are seasoned travelers and fly a lot with many different airlines but LATAM are by far the worst airline I have ever had the misfortune to deal with. They are incompetent liars and when things go wrong their customer service is abysmal. I don’t know if they are purposely being completely ineffective hoping that I will give up or if they just don’t have the training and skills to deal with customers. I am surprised that they are allowed to be part of the one world alliance as they tarnish the brand. Every flight we have ever taken with them has been delayed and the check in process is chaos regardless of the airport, with long queues. On the 5th Sep we flew from Calama to Buenos Aires via Santiago. The time for boarding came and went without any announcement so we went to see what was happening. The ground staff were running around telling everyone that the flight was overbooked and couldn’t leave until they removed some bags and passengers. They were asking for passengers to volunteer not to take the flight so that it could depart. They were physically collecting people’s boarding passes from them. Initially they said they needed 20 passengers to volunteer in order for the flight to leave and then they said they needed an additional 12. We eventually left without a single seat spare. Then when we reached Santiago, my husband and I ran to the gate for our connection and reached there 1 hour before departure, as boarding was commencing but the LATAM staff refused us access to our flight, even though we had boarding passes. They said we were not allowed to fly on a plane without our bags and that they were unable to get our bags onto that flight due to the delay to our previous flight. We were told no later flights were available to the airport we had booked but that we would be booked onto a flight 2 hours later to a different Buenos Aires airport. This was so that we could supposedly fly with our bags, as per their policy. We were given new boarding cards, with seats in the 6th row and asked to wait. When we went to board the later plane we realised it was a much smaller and older plane than the one we had booked. It had no entertainment and was dirty. Then the icing on the cake was when we went to board they told us we couldn’t sit in our assigned seats and had been moved to the back of the plane because our seats had been given to someone else. When we eventually landed, you can imagine how horrified we were that after the sequence of LATAM failures that we had already endured, our bags did not arrive. We had been lied to about why we couldn’t board our original connection and why we had to fly to another airport and endure further delays. We queued at the baggage counter for a further hour trying to report our missing bags. We were told that the bags were still in Santiago but that there was no way of knowing when they would arrive in Buenos Aires. We were instructed to wait in our apartment at all times in case our bags arrived as no time or day could be given. We waited 3 days (it was a 4 night break to BA) before our bags arrived and our entire trip was wasted. More than one month later we have no resolution from LATAM. They now say that our issue was caused by “weather conditions” they don’t answer any of our questions when we write to them and they take 15-20 days each time they need to reply to a message.

Meals acceptable although the LATAM food plan is mean on quantities, no starter, no bread and small packaged sweet. Getting a drinks refill takes patience and repeated requests.

Had to bribe someone,Ivan Oscar Sterza,,LATAM Airlines,Trip Verified,"  Santiago de Chile to Sao Paulo. Latam lounge in Santiago nice, with lots of space and some privacy as well, food surprisingly good (some high quality chirashi, for example), with a wide selection of wines and drinks. Onboard experience with Latam today is a mixed bag, it used to be a premium airline let's say 10 years ago but doesn't feel it any longer. This time our B777-300 was an old, really old TAM aircraft, interior had seen much better days and seats were worn out (on the brink of breaking down in some places, with some tape here and there). Seats were in a 2-2-2 configuration without direct aisle access for most passengers, therefore (unless you were in the central pair of seats) either you climb on your neighbour or you get climbed upon to gain aisle access; all in all narrow seat, not very comfortable. I read Latam will retrofit all long haul aircraft to a new business class cabin, I really hope this happens soon as today the feeling is all but premium. Boarding was sort of an ""all-in"" experience since, although priority was enforced, we had to wait some 20 minutes to actually get on the plane (everybody from one door), therefore once we boarded there was a general mess that prevented FAs to be somehow useful to premium passengers. Once in flight, service was just OK (crew not that much interested in providing anything more than what was needed), food bland and amenities almost non existent even in a 4 hours flight. Left on time - arrived on time. One big plus with Latam is the bedding, with large fluffy pillow and a soft white duvet; nice but not enough to save this flight from an average overall feeling.",Solo Leisure,September 2018,Melbourne to Santiago,Business Class,4.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,6,no

"Dirty, ancient aircraft",G Harper,2018-09-27,LATAM Airlines,Trip Verified,"  
Melbourne to Santiago. I wouldn't fly with LATAM again. This is a long flight and though the Boeing 787 is a nice quiet aircraft the squashed 3-3-3 seat configuration and short distance between seats makes it a bit like a domestic flight. We found the cabin staff to be uninterested - except in an older couple in the row in front of us whom various staff spent the first couple of hours chatting to - leaning on others seats and blocking the aisles. When it came to meal times, this couple were given first choice of meals - then after normal meal service had finished were given another meal - different to what was available to the rest of the economy cabin. The food was bland and small servings. There didn't appear to be any of the usual between meals snack available on other airlines. We were an hour late leaving Melbourne and still an hour late arriving, that gave us 10 min to make our connection. Staff were unhelpful in providing advice on what we should, so we just packed all our stuff up before landing and as soon as the seatbelt signs went off we ran to the front of the plane. As it turns out it only took 5 minutes to get to the next gate - where we discovered that the connecting flight was also delayed. We waited 45 minutes without explanation. When we did board we were seated about the cargo loading doors and noticed our bags being loaded - an hour after we had landed.",Couple Leisure,September 2018,Sao Paulo to Frankfurt,Economy Class,5.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,4,no

The service across the board was excellent. Check in was fast and painless. LATAM uses the Qantas Business Lounge at Sydney Airport which is always nice. The aircraft was a relatively new Boeing 787-8. Service from the crew onboard was top notch they were friendly and efficient and really looked after the passengers well. LATAM have a really nice Business Class seat on their 787's. The seat is extremely comfortable with many different options and choices for reclining. In the flat bed position the seat is also very comfortable. The food onboard was fresh and tasty. LATAM have a extensive range of non alcoholic and alcoholic beverage choices so you never run out of options. The inflight entertainment was superb with a huge variety of TV Shows, movies, games and music. The inflight entertainment is also very easy to use.

Worst customer service,K Galion,2018-09-14,LATAM Airlines,Trip Verified,"  Flight from Santiago to Frankfurt with connection in Sao Paulo. Airplane arrived to Santiago with 1 hour delay, once boarded aircraft maintenance was required which delayed the flight an additional hour. During the flight the attendants made no mention about passengers who would loose their connections (30-40 people). The aircraft was old the tvs would not work and the meal was bland and untastefull (sandwich with margarine and cheese). Once landed in Sao Paulo two incredibly ignorant, arrogant and unhelpfull staff began trying to explain and solve the connection problems, using their cellphones to contact their superiors. Even though they had knowledge from 6 hours ago that the flight was delayed they hadn't prepared any solution for any passenger, trying to resolve our connection issues when he had just landed. We ended up loosing the flight to Frankfurt and they informed us we would have to wait for the next flight which was in 24 hours, upon pressing and complaining more they gave us tickets for a flight to Barcelona and then to Berlin which would save us around 7 hours. They gave us vouchers for transportation and a hotel that was 40 kms away from the airport. The hotel was mediocre and in an industrial neighborhood. In short we have lost 24 hours due to LATAM'S innoperance. Their staff is incredibly ignorant and disrespectfull and it is clear that this is the way this company operates.

Cannot say anything negative,S Harris,2018-09-12,LATAM Airlines,Trip Verified,"  Sao Paulo to Frankfurt. A terribly disorganized, unhelpful and substandard airline from start to finish. I experienced many issues with this airline, some of which are below. Old and tired looking aircraft on both legs. On return journey our flight was changed last minute while awaiting boarding due to a technical fault that resulted in a missed connection and delay of over five hours. No information was provided at all either en route or upon landing for connecting passengers. Finally spoke to an incredibly rude representative at the LATAM desk in Hall C (Frankfurt airport) who informed us that we were re-booked onto two flights to reach our destination (Dublin) despite there being availability on a direct flight later that evening with BA/Aer Lingus operated. We were told LATAM doesn't have an agreement with these airlines and LATAM refused to transfer us to that available flight. We were then given an 8€ voucher for meals and refreshments - when we spoke to the manager she said this was the maximum refreshments voucher value they would provide. A coffee and piece of cake in Starbucks cost about basically much...Eventually arrived back in Dublin via Frankfurt and Amsterdam 5hr 15mins later than intended which very much affected our previously arranged plans. Other LATAM highlights include small, bland meals, no spirits (vodka, gin etc) available, impolite and/or uninformed staff and a total lack of empathy or help even when their airline is completely in the wrong.

by far the worst airline,P Thomson,2018-09-08,LATAM Airlines,Trip Verified," I recently had the misfortune of travelling on LATAM from South Africa to Brazil, a route I fly often but my first time on LATAM. I have five specific complaints, number 5 is the best! 1) My bag did not make the connection from CPT to GRU in JNB. I waited more than 4 days for the bag to be delivered after it was actually left at GRU airport after it arrived in GRU after the next flight I was on with no action by the airline. There was no immediate compensation or assistance, told to mail their call center and I will receive USD 25 in my bank account within 2 weeks? Not sure how that helps. 2) Food portions on board, strange hot meal only concept with no bread, salad, desert etc. 11 hour flight and everybody hungry. Breakfast a single slice of bread and a yogurt on a long haul flight? Cost cutting mixed with a consultant that never spoke to customers managing catering? 3) Crew and Call Center staff do not speak English, I can understand if there is only basic English but no English is a concern in a safety situation. 4) Delay on the return flight of 2.5 hours, delays happen which is fine but it is obvious that the JNB route is treated as a route that is left for a last resort maintenance aircraft, checking flight radar the flight was delayed on all days I could check. 5) My biggest issue! On my return trip I would miss my connection in JNB to CPT due to the delay, no issue as I would be rebooked on the next flight, my original connection was on Comair, I was then moved to SAA. When I asked for my boarding pass for my connecting flight I was told I would receive it in JNB. On arrival in JNB SAA said I had no booking at the check in counter, I was referred to ticketing. At ticketing I was told that LATAM had used my JNB-CPT coupon for the GRU-JNB segment and they could not accept me for travel. I was referred to the LATAM office managed by Menzies. Menzies informed me that they could not help and that I must wait for LATAM staff to complete the departure of the outbound flight, needless to say 6 hours later I was in CPT!

food plan is mean on quantities,C Banillos,2018-08-28,LATAM Airlines,Trip Verified,"  Santiago to Melbourne. First of all, once we boarded and were seated the captain said that due to inconvenience with the aircraft we would have to wait for 30 minutes, this meant that everyone should get off the plane. That 30 min delay turned out in a 6 hour delay. Once in the plane they gave us a menu so as to choose the food we wanted to eat, but as if they were joking us, they later said that they did not have that food because they confused when loading it in the aircraft. After the 14 hour flight to Melbourne and arriving almost at midnight, I received my baggage broken. Customer service people at Melbourne airport were super kind. However, when going to the place where they told me my luggage was going to be replaced, the guy at the shop told me they no longer worked for LATAM because of the amount of broken baggage. I had a bad trip, but I am really disappointed with the workers at LATAM, they are uninformed and treat its clients in a disrespectful manner.",Solo Leisure,May 2018,Frankfurt to Sao Paulo,Economy Class,5.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,5.0,2,no

We missed our first day of our trip, because LATAM sold our prepaid tickets, so we had to wait 6 hours at the airport, to get another flight.

I wouldn't fly LATAM again,Belinda Bridgen,2018-07-29,LATAM Airlines,Trip Verified,"  I needed to check in an extra bag for my LATAM flights within Peru. The website made it clear that the cost was double if paid for at the airport - however there was no provision to add an extra bag in advance online (as with every other airline) not even when online check in opened. By then I was in Peru and, not being a Spanish speaker, asked my concierge to phone LATAM to purchase additional baggage. After a call lasting an hour they processed my credit card and then said a mistake had been made and they had charged US$161 instead of 161 Peruvian Soles. At this point the call was cut off. The concierge called back and was told the mistake had been reversed and then charged me the correct fee of US$50. In fact the erroneous charge had not been reversed. I have made numerous phone calls, filled in the correct forms and made 2 written complaints through the website. This has generated 4 different case numbers but no substantive reply let alone a refund. Further phone calls say the cases are closed. My travel agent has also tried through their agents here and in Peru but have had no response. 4 months have passed.

I would never recommend it,J Malesa,2018-07-26,LATAM Airlines,Trip Verified,"  Cuzco to Puerto Maldonado. We got left behind while at the gate because the had sold more tickets than they can seat. Our tickets were purchased and were waiting to go inside when they said they couldn’t allow more passengers. After complaint for a long time we gave up and opted for some sort of compensation and for our flight to be for the next day and the day of return to be posted for another extra day since we were only staying for two days. So they agreed to give us tickets for July 25 and our return on the 27 so we could stay 2 days to visit. When we went to check in on the 25 for our flight we wanted to make sure our return date was on the 27 and they had told us that it was the next day. We were annoyed and extremely mad because they had previously confirmed that our return date was the 27 not the 26. Again after arguing back and fourth they finally said they had our seats confirmed for the 27 but who knows if they’re lying once again to get us to just leave and someone else deal with us. We have a family member that works in puerto claiming they were lying that they couldn’t get us our tickets. According to her, on the system they had open seats on a flight but they wouldn’t give it to us. We had to ask for our money back since this was getting absurd.

flight was cancelled,Baldonick Fernandez,2018-07-15,LATAM Airlines,Trip Verified," On June 7th, 2018 I called the LATAM Customer service about my baggage allowance for a flight to Bucaramanga, Colombia.

So, I got a huge surprise at Check-In in Miami when I was forced to pay $100 for the Golf Bag for being a sporting equipment bag, this is ridiculous since that it is not the case on other airlines and I bought the Airline Ticket under False Pretense!

canceled at the check in,Benjamin Owen,2018-07-14,LATAM Airlines,Trip Verified," My family (wife and two-year-old daughter) and I flew from Sao Paulo, Brazil to Los Angeles, California in May. The flights themselves were fine, but when we arrived in LA we found that all our luggage was lost. Annoying, but relatively common. One of the items Latam lost was our carseat which was needed for us to drive home. Latam's response ""there's nothing we can do."" Giving out loaner car seats in this situation is common practice at every other major airline. Latam's ""solution"" was for me to drive around LA at 10pm to find an open store and purchase a new carseat (not sure what would've happened if my wife was traveling alone with our daughter?). All this added 4 hours to our travel time getting us home very late and with a very tired two-year-old. We were told by everyone we at Latam LAX that we would be reimbursed by Latam for the purchase price of the carseat we were forced to buy AND we would get all our property back. We received our luggage 4 days later, but no carseat (wrapped up with the carseat was a small, antique, wooden stool a family member gave our daughter which can not be replaced). We contacted Latam and they said it can't be found and that the case was closed because we were already reimbursed for the purchase price of the carseat we were forced to buy (the price of the carseat we lost was MUCH higher than the one we bought in a panic). We have still not been reimbursed for our lost property and are just repeatedly being told they can't do anything. Every step of this process has been horrible. From the staff at LAX to the call center staff to the email exchanges. Everyone has treated us like it is our fault they lost our property. I have repeatedly been told by the call center staff there is no supervisor or manager on duty (a blatant lie, there's no such thing as a call center with no supervisors). This has been a horrible (and expensive) experience. I will never fly with Latam again and suggest nobody does!

Flight attendants efficient,Mark Morris,,LATAM Airlines,Trip Verified,"  We live in Pucallpa, Peru. The last 5 interactions with Latam Airlines have all been disappointing. They let me sit in the airplane on the tarmac for 1.5 hours, then had us return to wait in the terminal for another 2 hours. Then they cancelled the flight. I believe they knew the whole time there was a technical problem with the plane the whole time, but waited until we could not have rescheduled to one of the other 4 flights that left that night. I saw them pull the luggage loading ramp up to the plane to take the luggage off the plane 2 hours before they cancelled the flight. They then rescheduled for the next morning. As a result, I did not meet my friend in Lima who flew out the next morning - the main purpose for my flight. Lots of people then missed their connecting flight to the United States. A nightmare for the traveler and for us who are supporting their trip. Our visitor's flight from Lima to Pucallpa was cancelled due to ""fog"". They did not take off from Lima for another 3 hours. Today I went to pickup another group flying Latam. This flight came to Pucallpa, but did not land because of ""fog"", then flew back to Lima. What a waste of time It seems like they are flying VFR (Visual Flight Regulations). They probably will not come now until the regularly scheduled evening flight - another 12 hours. How can they not know the weather conditions? How can they fly a commercial plane that cannot land in what I would call ""mild"" fog? As a side note, the arrival monitor said that the flight had landed. It is a problem living in a culture where it is so easy to lie. Yesterday, another visitor who purchased her ticket with Latam 3+ months ago, checked in with Latam 3 hours before the flight and was told it was overbooked and would have to wait 12 hours before the next flight. Ridiculous ! We had her buy a ticket on Peruvian and come much sooner. Latam now has a policy for different fares for different amount of luggage. In the process of booking my flight, it seemed like they were extracting fees for what is normal on other airlines here in Peru. They said my carry-on was too large and charged me $25 dollars. My carry on is a regulation size and I have never had a problem with the other airlines in Peru carrying it on for the past 6 years. The bottom line: Visitors come for 6 or 7 days, and are wasting up to 2 days of their trip because Latam does not deliver their flights on time. I would choose Peruvian Airlines, Star Peru, or LC Peru. Note: Watch LC Peru's luggage limits if you are coming from the USA with 2 bags (LC flys smaller airplanes).

Never use this airline,R Magic,2018-06-26,LATAM Airlines,Trip Verified,"  Los Angeles to Lima. My wife and I are planning a trip to Peru and were purchasing tickets as usual through Cathay Pacific website from Hong Kong to Lima (Peru) with transit in LA. As there was no option to book business class tickets for LA to Lima part of the trip in the end we have purchased only Hong Kong to LA through Cathay Pacific and decided to use the LATAM website to purchase business class tickets for LA to Lima on the same day. Everything was great until the payment part on LATAM website. Once we have entered the Visa CC details and clicked on pay now we have instantly received message that payment is rejected and to try making the payment again with provided link. As we were surprised with the message we have tried to make payment using MasterCard which in the end was also rejected by the website (ticketing office). At this pint we were scared about what has happened and decided to contact LATAM customer service directly. The CS officer picked up the call relatively fast and we have given him the reservation code to which he mentioned that the reservation is visible in the system but that their website sometimes rejects payments for no apparent reason. After waiting awhile for him to check with his manager he has offered to put us through to phone payment option where we again imputed our credit card details to be put on hold for another 5-10 minutes. The CS officer got back to us saying that unfortunately they are not able to accept payment over the phone at this time and in case we would like to keep the reservation we would need to go to ONE WORLD partner ticketing office in Hong Kong and make payment by presenting reservation code in matter of several days. As everything was done on Saturday I drove for 2 hours to HK airport and Cathay Pacific (one world partner) ticketing office to make the payment. At the counter I was told that CP is not able to accept payments for any other OneWorld partner ticket reservations. At this moment we called LATAM Customer Service again and they have said they are sorry for giving us wrong information but if we try again through their website the payment would now be accepted. I have gone online to try purchasing the tickets again while on the phone with CS but the price has risen more than 100% at the time. As we had reservation pending for payment in worth of cca US$7500 they didn't want to offer us the same price but told us that we have to pay US$16000 as the price displayed on their website at present. After complaining to CS over the phone they have said that they are not able to help us with problem anymore and if we want to complain we can do so online. So not only we lost the acceptable price for Business Class tickets, money for 2 hours worth of international calls but we were also scared as our connecting flights might not match. At this moment we had to contact Cathay Pacific to help us purchase connecting flight economy class by cancelling HK-LA tickets and reissuing HK-Lima tickets. It was the worst CS handling of a problem caused by either really lousy website or poor security center team for their payments as payment went through 3d authentication. Now we have a long flight with really busy schedule in Peru with no chance of relaxing on the airplane ahead of us.

However, the check-in agent was exceptional, well beyond what was expected. I was one of the last to board as l used the services of an airline lounge (Marhaba) which was well worth the entrance fee of $65.  The economy cabin was totally full. Although this is low season l was surprised to see a full cabin. Cabin crew were quite attentive and smart in their blue uniforms . The aircraft cabin look very new and clean. To be expected for a relatively new B787. IFE was more than adequate with a very good mix of new release and other favourite shows, television and music options. Dinner and drinks were served soon after take off. Options were available and l chose the chicken which was a very good choice. Tasty indeed. The one issue l had with the cabin service was the time it took to clear our meal trays. I should point out one it is one of my biggest peeves and it becomes annoying when crew walk down the aisle noticing most pax have finished their meals yet seem to take their time clearing them. LATAM please take note! This is quite a long flight clocking in at 13.5 hours to SCL. I managed to get some sleep and wasn't too bothered missing out on breakfast. Landing was on time. I had a 3.5 layover for my connection to EZE. The connecting flight was smooth, on time and with a 00:55 departure, all l wanted was sleep.

I called Latam's helpline who did a stellar job: he checked me in and e mailed me a boarding pass (something which Aeromexico previously refused to do).

Latam does not deliver on time,G Renois,2018-05-09,LATAM Airlines,Trip Verified,"  Sao Paulo to Curitiba. Bought from UAE domestic ticket with their partner OneTravel. Tried to buy luggage together it says have to contact airline. Unable to find well specified on their website how to purchase it in advance. One day before the flight when go do check in online try to purchase 23 kg one luggage very hard to find. When put in google “buy luggage Latam” comes to webpage to purchase the first 23 kg for 40 US dollars instead of 40 BLR reais as its written in another page. Have to call my sister in Brazil, ask her to call a Latam agency and ask what is going on. They dont help at beginning until she insist and they send her the link to purchase it with the correct price. Me and my fiance who was coming to Brazil for the first time were very dissaponted with this airline as we feel, they are trying to take advantage of the foreigners who dont know their actual prices.",Couple Leisure,January 2018,Iguassu Falls to Rio de Janeiro,Economy Class,5.0,4.0,2.0,,3.0,3,no
got a good deal price wise,C Carter,2018-05-07,LATAM Airlines,Trip Verified, Santiago to Sydney via Auckland. LATAM offered my husband and I a travel voucher to delay our flight by 24 hours as they were overbooked. We felt this was a good deal at the time but I would warn other these vouchers are extremely difficult to use! We could not book online so called the call centre (very poor quality call centre) and spent over 60 minutes on the phone- paid for the tickets and then we were disconnected. Our tickets were never issued yet the payment was taken. The issue is not resolved with the airline over 1 week later and we can’t get through to anyone to sort the issue out.

price has risen more than 100%,C Jones,2018-04-26,LATAM Airlines,Trip Verified," Barcelona to São Paulo. LATAM is not crediting my miles on my BA account every time I fly with them, even though my frequent flyer is on my ticket I have to call BA to get them credited. It is very annoying as I don't have the same problem with other OneWorld airlines. Worst, on my last business flight from São Paulo to Barcelona I couldn't get my miles credited at all, BA said it has been credited already in a different account even though my BA number is on the ticket! They suggested me to contact LATAM I did and they say the same thing, that it has been credited to my Latam account which I don't have and I don't want! The weird part is that my partner, who did a flight from Barcelona to Sao Paulo in different dates, had the same problem and he is AA frequent flyer, so LATAM is getting miles from OneWorld clients and given them to someone else!",Couple Leisure,April 2018,Sydney to Auckland,Business Class,2.0,2.0,4.0,,3.0,1,no
their app didn't update,E Smyth,2018-04-24,LATAM Airlines,Trip Verified, Iguassu Falls to Rio de Janeiro. Easy check in and far better than the chaos we had at Sao Paolo. Airport was small. However all that matters with these short domestic flights in my view is safety and punctuality. LATAM seems to deliver both. At bigger airports the gates can change a bit from that which you are originally told so you have to be aware. The flights I took all had at least one staff member who spoke English.

We weren’t disappointed,P Huang,2018-04-16,LATAM Airlines,Trip Verified,"  Sydney to Auckland. A very disappointing experience this time around, not that I was expecting other the top service but it was below average. To start off, the Check-In was slow as the Ground Team was more worried about having a briefing then prioritising the passengers. I wasn't given a fast track pass through security as they had none even when they seem to be organised. Upon boarding, again there was no priority for High Tiered and Premium passengers and main reason being it was a bus gate. The Crew onboard were very mediocre, absolutely no one stood out even with their extra touches. Pre-departure drinks took a long time to get around with a very basic amenity kit given straight after. The catering was okay nothing amazing with selections or taste. At least the IFE was decent, plenty of options though I couldn't compare it with Emirates offering. Overall I think the Team needs to be more personal, smile more and prioritise the passengers.",Solo Leisure,April 2018,Santiago to Auckland,Business Class,2.0,2.0,2.0,,1.0,5,yes
Cabin is old design,PETER SORGER,2018-04-16,LATAM Airlines,Trip Verified,"  Sao Paulo to Foz de Iguacu. Unfortunately in recent months there has been a drop in the quality of services offered by LATAM. From a faulty online booking system that has been in maintenance for months, as well as a total lack of motivation on the part of the employees, mainly in LATAM BRAZIL. At the check-in for passengers with Status Loyalty / Lanpass simply in Guarulhos there is no one, three employees chatting at check-in the lolzes understand the atmosphere of professionalism of the Company. Boarding via remote location. After takeoff the cabin crew disappears in the galleys and you can find them eating and talking. The on-board service, no free drinks - no free snacks (they are worse then US airlines), begins 30 minutes after take-off on a 1:25 flight. Notice the total lack of interest on the part of the crew in ""selling"" the products offered and disappear quickly into the Galley. In a market where there have been months of increasing criticism of Latam and services equivalent to a ""low cost"", there is a change from a corporate client to better companies in the market such as Avianca, Azul and Gol (the latter improving every time more). And at the end of the trip, a questionnaire is received from the LATAM President Customers Relations with a questionnaire to be pre-filled; sign that the company is concerned. I suggest checking why so many Premium customers are no longer flying with LATAM, and you are doing nothing to keep them.",Business,March 2018,Lima to Talara,Economy Class,4.0,2.0,3.0,,2.0,1,no

Disaster at Buenos Aires,C Durren,2018-04-09,LATAM Airlines,Trip Verified,"  Late night departure out of Santiago to Auckland, Business class was about 1/2 full and crew very prompt in serving an excellent dinner and clearing so those who wanted to sleep could settle quickly. Within 90mins of departure a 4 course meal with great wines had been served and cleared. Breakfast served when you wanted it and I liked the menu card that let you make selections and build the breakfast. Business class on these 787 is in my opinion excellent. Good range of new release movies, professional crew, high quality quilts and pillows and comfortable beds, matched with great food and beverage. Premium check in area at SCL is excellent but hard to find if you weren't made aware in advance, I like how it leads directly to Latam's lounge.

A reliable service,C Mealen,2018-04-05,LATAM Airlines,Trip Verified,"  My wife and I have been flying Lan for about ten years. Lan used to be a very good airline, but after the merger with Tam it went to hell big time. The list of ordeals that we have experienced with LATAM are endless. They include one time when they completely lost the record of my wife's Business Class flight from LA to Lima. If you have to make a change in your ticket forget it. You will just have to buy a whole new ticket. I have lost numerous tickets because of that. Sometimes their change fees exceed the cost of the original ticket. Their customer service is the worst ever. If you have a problem their standard answer is that will open a ""case."" Then you never hear from them again. One time my wife (who is Peruvian) asked why they had not responded to a ""case"" that they had opened. They said that they would open a case to see why the ""case had not been answered. If you go into a Lan office in Lima it is full of angry customers. One time my wife went into the office and bought a ticket. The agent booked it on the wrong day. Even there right in front of my wife she could not change it to the correct flight. She said that the computer would not allow her to do it. Another time we had a problem with one of my wife's purchased Business Class flights. We called Lan's Customer Service and were connected to one of their call centers in Columbia. The agent put us on ""hold"" except that he actually did not put us on hold. We could hear him laughing about my wife's problem in the background with some of the other agents. What kind of an airline is this?  Unfortunately Lan has a government arranged monopoly on some domestic Peruvian routes. Another thing, Lan -- unlike any other airline in Peru -- charges more than double the fare for non-Peruvian residents. I just priced a flight for my wife and me: $80 for her and $196 for me.",Couple Leisure,March 2018,Auckland to Santiago,Economy Class,3.0,4.0,2.0,,3.0,1,no
Worst experience ever,S Lamatore,,LATAM Airlines,Trip Verified,"  In a previous post I have described the total lack of onboard service in a 3 hours flight from REC to GRU.

OW flight for 300 USD and no service at all. Narrow space for your leg. Before to be merged with LAN, TAM had a great service. Today you pay a top price for a no-frills service.

Tried to buy luggage,C Edwards,2018-03-30,LATAM Airlines,Trip Verified," Auckland to Santiago on Latam (Qantas Ticket but LA aircraft) I could not fault the service, comfort or overall experience. It was excellent. Latam applies an ""old school"" spacing between the seats in J Class (787) and along with a very long flat bed there was a real sense of space and comfort. High quality duvet, pillow and seat encourages deep sleep. Food and wine was a high point and crew seem to take genuine pride in presenting Chilean fare and hospitality. Airlines and their crew should represent their culture and Latam was a great intro to Chile. Plane was full and crew to pax ratio was good, toilets always clean but tiny (that's the same in every Dreamliner). Latam does seem to get a lot of negative feedback on its regional flights but this long haul flight was worthy of 5 stars, only request - PJ's would be good! Bags took a while, but this was a conveyor belt issue and probably not Latam's fault.",Solo Leisure,February 2018,Melbourne to Santiago,Business Class,2.0,4.0,2.0,,4.0,10,yes
very poor customer service,Marjolein Mooij,,LATAM Airlines,Trip Verified,"  I was flying from Rio Branco  to Curitiba. When we were waiting for the flight to open, the information on screen changed to 'delayed', but no one cared to inform us. Only after an hour they called out the landing ground had been 'too wet' for the plane to land, and therefore we would have to wait for more information.  It took another 1,5 hours before we heard that our flight was truly cancelled, so even though it was already clear we wouldn't be flying at 11 pm, action was undertaken only around 2 am. We then had to wait for 1,5 hour for vans to drive us to hotels in Rio Branco. They had ordered only 3 and we were with way too many people. If they had ordered more at 11, the progress would have been quicker. In the meantime, almost nobody spoke English, and the staff kept reassuring us that the vans would arrive in 10 minutes (which would mean at least 40 minutes). The worst experience, however, was with the online customer service. I wanted to do an online check-in, but I needed a Brazilian CPF for that, which I don't have because I'm Dutch. It took me literally 4 hours to make them answer me and even then they responded very inadequately, slowly, they misread my questions on purpose to give the wrong answers and they made me pay double for check-in at the airport because their website is not functioning properly. I'm still waiting for them to compensate the made expenses, but so far I'm not expecting anything anymore. Sidenote: their planes are not comfortable if you're taller than 1,60m and don't expect to be served any food or water. Long story short: if cancelled flights, extremely long waiting times and terrible customer service are your thing, go fly with LATAM!

Medium quality cabin service,S Mildon,2018-03-16,LATAM Airlines,Trip Verified,"  I did some international (Santiago-Buenos Aires) and domestic flights in South America on LATAM. Their website is poor but generally I didn’t have much problems with their administration, although most flights had delays of some sort that were not handled well (the first flight was moved without notice to a 15 minute earlier departure and even boarded early but then we didn’t take off until 30 minutes after the original departure time). The staff were generally good - even though check-in is often confusing, staff were helpful and very fast. Some flights were on A320s - old fit out and no seat-back screens (you can stream entertainment from their app but there are no power points so battery life is an issue). The others were on 787s - much newer and roomier but with some strange design like the seat cushions moving around and having an uncomfortable gap at the back and the seat-back screens being fixed, so if the person in front reclines their seat, you have to watch at an angle. Short flights get just a drink, medium flights get snack food and the flights to Easter Island had full meals but they weren’t very good. Generally there’s no alcohol available (which must be a regional thing as I noticed it on Aerolineas as well) but strangely there was alcohol on the flight from Easter Island (but not the flight to Easter Island). Several flights used remote stands and buses, which is always horrible, but I didn’t think LATAM managed them very well, like holding up buses for staff. At boarding, they sometimes strictly enforced boarding by rows and sometimes completely ignored it. The more I flew them the more irritating they got but they’ll do the job and no other South American airlines seem to stand out.",Solo Leisure,September 2017,Mexico City to Montevideo via Sao Paulo,Economy Class,4.0,1.0,2.0,,1.0,6,no

Could not check in online neither on callcenter because of a lack on the system. Santiago de Chile´s LATAM Lounge is big but with very low standards, only some strange sandwiches (at 2pm) and some other unrecognizable food. Boeing 767 amazingly dated. Overhead compartments did not close securely, old seats, and even older feeling and looks. As seen on the pictures, lots of seat parts missing! Filthy.

World’s Best Airlines in 2024,R Rodgers,2018-03-08,LATAM Airlines,Trip Verified,"  Mexico City to Montevideo via Sao Paulo.  My group was totally hustled / ripped off in Mexico City. After flying into Mexico City from Los Angeles on Alaska Airlines, and waiting in a line of literally 1000+ people in customs (just for an international connection to Sao Paulo, Brazil) we arrived at the ticket counter about an hour before the flight, waited in line for about 15 minutes, got to the ticketing agent, and were told that it was ""impossible"" for us to board our scheduled flight, because LATAM flights close 1 hour before flight time (who does this?). We were then told that the next flight would be 24 hours later, and that there was nothing they could do, other than charge us each another $270 for a ""transfer fee"" to get us on the flight the following day. We were there in time, in line, there were at least 4 employees at their computers and only 1 agent actually helping a customer at a time. They then referred us to the Hilton hotel in the airport, where we had to pay an additional $288 for a room that we were forced to get since they did not allow us our boarding passes, where we could have been at the boarding gate with a good 40-45 minutes to spare before wheels up. When boarding the flight the next day, I spoke with 2 boarding agents at the gate, and they said they close the flight routinely about 25-30 minutes before flight time. Thus, we would have easily made our original flight. After posting our dilemma on Facebook, I learned from several people that LATAM has a HISTORY of doing this to others. And after reading reviews from several different sites, it seems to be very true. This appears to be some sort of racket, and I want to know how LATAM is willing to compensate for the additional almost $400USD that I was forced to spend due to deception and flat out lies we were told.  In addition, in the other legs of my trip flying on LATAM, we would be told to go to a certain gate, Gate 4 for example. There would be all the passengers sitting in front of gate 4 waiting for boarding agents to arrive. Not too long before the flight was supposed to leave, there was still no LATAM employees there at the gate we were told to be at. After checking the flight monitors again, we would discover that the gate number had been changed to Gate 17. There was no announcement by LATAM regarding the gate change, no LATAM employees at the original gate to let us know that the gate had changed, and thus there were dozens of passengers running through the airport trying to get to the new gate and not miss the flight. What the hell is going on over there? This happened twice in our return trip; once in Montevideo, Uruguay, and again in Santiago, Chile. I hope that LATAM understands the severity of this negligence, and is willing to make up for it. LATAM doesn't give a damn about their customers, and is involved in a racket to extort extra money from their customers, especially in Mexico City.",Solo Leisure,December 2017,Madrid to Frankfurt,Economy Class,2.0,4.0,2.0,,5.0,1,no

The plane was quite old, it had a horrible smell like urine. At first, I thought it was just me who noticed the smell but other passengers were complaining too. We all thought the smell was coming from the lavatories but realised that it was the plane that had the horrible odour. The seats looked old and dirty. After several hours into the flight, I had become nose blind and had forgotten about the smell.

THE BEST AIRLINE CABIN CREW,Alberto Battistin,2018-02-27,LATAM Airlines,Trip Verified,"  Milan to Santa Genoveva via Sao Paulo. On the way there it was Milan to São Paulo and on the way back it was São Paulo to Paris. This review counts for both flights. The only thing that is saving this airline from getting a 1 star review is the fact that the staff (ground and flight) is very friendly and tries to help. Both airplanes were old, dirty, loud and poorly serviced. Many of the entertainment screens weren't working, there was garbage and gum in the seat pocket, the tray tables were brown and broken, the toilets were not cleaned during the flight, which was quite a disgusting find when after 11h I had to use the toilet. On the B773 usually the outer rows of seats have 2 floor mounts, which are intelligently placed between the three seats, and therefore don't disturb leg space. On the LATAM B773 there are three floor mounts, which are positioned exactly were your legs want to be and therefore reduce the legs a lot. If that isn't enough, LATAM installed a footrest on every seat (which is literally a net that lays on the floor) so the leg space is reduced even more! On a 12h flight we were served dinner with one drink just after takeoff (one hot dish and a little sweet snack, no brad, no butter, nothing else), and then breakfast just before landing (a small fruit salad and something to go with it). For the remaining duration of the flight, the cabin crew hid in the galley with the curtains closed. I attached a picture of the safety card, which basically sums up what the cabin looks like.

"really good flight
",Richard Lambert,2018-02-24,LATAM Airlines,Trip Verified,  We had booked to fly from Flrianopolis to London on 22nd December. I have flown with TAM/LATAM for 7 years and a gold frequent flyer member. When we arrived in Florianopolis for the flight having downloaded our boarding passes 2 days before with assigned seat numbers we were told that there was a problem with the aircraft(1st lie) on the London leg and cancelled our reservation. The local LATAM sales staff said they could route us via Casablanca to London with Royal Air Maroc (2nd Lie) and they tagged our luggage accordingly. We checked in for the booked flight to Sao Paulo. When we arrived in Sao Paulo we looked at the Departures board and there was no problem with the flight to London and Royal Air Maroc knew nothing of the reservation. We were kept at Sao Paulo until 2.00 am until our luggage was recovered. Whilst waiting there were 6 other passengers who had had their tickets cancelled because the London Flight had been overbooked. We were then booked on to the BA flight (much better service) the following day. Due to next day arrival in London my booked rental car was no longer available and I was faced with upgrade costs as it was now Christmas Eve. LATAM have refused to pay any compensation because their staff in Sao Paulo put as a reason for missing the original London Flight as a delay in the connecting flight (3rd Lie). I have followed their complaints procedures and made suggestions to settle the claim to no avail. As a regular traveller between Brazil and London they were presented options for future flights to settle my grievances amicably but to no avail. It appears that talking to the other passengers that had their tickets cancelled they all tell the same story. It is clear that LATAM use this form of fabrication of the truth to avoid paying out compensation for their continuing policy of overbooking flights. So much so for their Loyalty programme that clearly counts for nothing and as to their call centre based in Columbia they are a complete waste of time. Rest assured that in future I will be using an alternative airline.,Couple Leisure,July 2017,Auckland to Santiago,Economy Class,3.0,5.0,2.0,,1.0,1,no

Me and my friend used Latam Peru this summer in our trip from Cuba-Lima and Arequipa-Lima and Lima-Cuba again. The flight attendants are ok, but that was all it was ok about their flights! The nightmare started with a 2 hours delay, after we got to our destination, they have lost my friends suitcase. Once we got to the info point, no surprise, no one talked english (lucky we speak ok spanish) after hours of waiting.. they did not provide any funding to help us with the situation. When they finally find the luggage 3 days later, stuff was missing.  On our second flight, they didn't lost our luggage anymore, but we did not know that when you buy your tickets there is the separation between a citizen of Peru and all the other countries. So even though they asked for our citizenship when we bought the tickets, there was no message that the tickets we are about to buy can just be used by peruvian citizens. Therefore when we got to the airport was a huge fine of 250 euros each was waiting for us, because we bought the wrong tickets. The alternative was to cancel our flight without a refund.. In other words, i don't wish to anyone the experience we had with Latam, they made our experience in South America a terrible one.",Couple Leisure,January 2018,Lima to Iquitos,Economy Class,5.0,3.0,2.0,,1.0,1,no

top price for a no-frills service.,C Strauher,2018-01-30,LATAM Airlines,Trip Verified,"  Lima to Iquitos. First, it was LAN Chile, an excellent airline with superb service (nice food, games, extras, etc.). Then it changed to LAN Peru, the service was not that good anymore, but decent. After years of travelling in LAN,  the airline is now called LATAM (a merge between LAN and Brazilian TAM).  First, the trip was two hours delayed. Then, we could not choose our seats, so I was in row 1 and my friend in row 19. They did not give us any newspaper to read and no food, not even peanuts, pretzels or a glass of water. The ""entertainment online"" offered assumes you have a smart device with you (with enough space and batteries) and it also assumes that you had previously downloaded their app at the gate (do they have Wi-Fi there? , did somebody told you this before entering the plane?). So, it was one of the most boring trips! Fortunately, it was a 1.5 hour trip, but taking into account the initial plane's delay and the fact that you have to be two hours in advance at the airport, we ended up our trip starving. On the return flight, my friend and I got stocked-up with drinks, food, candy, magazines, and so on. The trip was quite expensive even! Definitely, no comparison between the high price of the plane ticket and the very poor service received. I can't imagine a longer trip with this airline.",Solo Leisure,January 2018,Santiago to Melbourne,Economy Class,4.0,5.0,2.0,,5.0,2,no

Well, no points for this airline, I have a ticket (for my partner), the amount for the ticket was charged to my credit card, and LATAM annulled the ticket without any notification. They have withheld the funds charged to my credit card, denied service, required me to deal with their inept ""call centre"", complete with poor audio, mumbling service representatives who pass customers from one clown to another in a pathetic imitation of customer service, without offering any kind odd solution.

avoid at all costs,L Sewler,,LATAM Airlines,Trip Verified,"  Santiago to Isla de Pascua. LATAM has the worst costumer service I have experienced. I was originally flying from Santiago to Cusco with a layover in Lima. Due to extenuating circumstances, I had to return to the USA early and I did not use my ticket from Santiago to Lima but was able to get a flight from the USA to Lima so as to catch my original flight from Lima to Cusco. LATAM refused to allow this and forced me to cancel the entire flight. I called them to inform them of my plan and was not asking for any sort of refund and they denied me the ability to do this. I will never fly with them again and don't recommend ever booking with them. ",Solo Leisure,January 2018,Lima to Santiago,Economy Class,1.0,1.0,2.0,,1.0,1,no
wonderful experience,Ingo Reisch,2018-01-14,LATAM Airlines,Trip Verified," Overall a great experience on this newly established direct flight from Santiago to Melbourne with Latam's new fleet of Dreamliners. For this long stretch Latam opts for the 900 Series providing the capacity for a 13.5-15 hr flight spending on direction of winds. Check-in in Santiago was super easy. The exclusive business check-in area is situated at level 3 of the airport, which is also where the VIP lounge is located. It took all of 5 minutes to check-in and go through the VIP passport and security control leading you directly into a very large lounge spread over 2 floors. Boarding commenced approx. 45 minutes before departure and doors were closed near enough at our scheduled departure time. To our surprise the scheduled 15 hour flight was reduced to 13.2 hrs. For me the layout of the 800 Series is nicer, but again no issue with the 900 Series. In-flight staff during the entire 13+ hr flight was non stop just looking after us, truly the busiest crew I have seen for a long time. We got dished out a lunch, a snack and a dinner approx. 2 hours before arrival. The food standards are OK, but not to compare to Singapore or Emirates. Even though an espresso pod machine should have been available, it was somehow out of action, which was disappointing. The South American wines are worth trying. Reds from Chile are amazing. Headphones are not the best in the air, with little or no noise cancellation benefits. No PJ's provided and the small amenity kit is also just OK, a trend with most airlines and why not as most of it ends up in the bin. On our flight no newspaper or magazine was available in English, a bit of a shame. The crew forgot to hand out migration forms and after asking 1 hr before landing I was told they had none on board. Minutes later they hastily started handing them out, however the crew wasn't familiar with the Australian requirements for each person to have a in-coming migration/customs form completed (both sides). Families were told only one per person was required. Further, business class passengers did not receive an Express card, which allows you to fast track passport and customs check-points. To add to this you can't use smart gates, as you must answer a question where you spend most time at and most South American countries prevent you to enter via the smart gates. Even though luggage was priority tagged our 4 cases had the pleasure to arrive right at the end. Back to the inflight experience, I mentioned to the purser that the right hand front toilet randomly would flush (also when you are sitting on it, which is a rather strange experience) and that the left hand lavatory had a faulty water tap, which was running non stop. After such a long day in the sky the purser wasn't really interested and told me the water tap issue is linked to the aircrafts hydraulics and it always happens at the start (2 hrs into the flight?) and yes the other toilet had a sensitive switch (clearly very sensitive as I never even touched it and it happened a few times). Aircraft Reg: CC-BGF in case Latam wants to get these items fixed. Overall the flight was great with amazing glimpses of the Antarctica, the crew were quite amazing and we arrived well in Melbourne without having to stop-over in Auckland NZ and sit there for 6 hours, so thank you Latam.",Family Leisure,January 2018,"Bogota, Colombia to Buenos Aires, Argentina",Business Class,3.0,2.0,2.0,,4.0,7,yes
seats smaller than ever,P Harris,2018-01-11,LATAM Airlines,Trip Verified," Flew LATAM Airlines from Montreal to Lima via New York. Worst company you could ask for! Absolutely no transparency with the customers, they had us stuck in the airport providing absolutely no explanation for 20 hours, telling us the flight will be there shortly every few hours. We later learned that the crew had actually left the airport hours ago. On arrival they lost all our luggage. Wouldn't have been bad except the fact they never delivered as promised, gave us phone numbers that are no longer in service and never returned any of our calls/emails. Our vacation ended up being ruined as we couldn't get out of the city so we could have a chance to recover our stuff.

working on your reimburse,Daniela Sanchez,2018-01-09,LATAM Airlines,Trip Verified," I had a dreadful experience with LATAM Airlines on my last trip. I had a flight from Bogota to Buenos Aires, stopping in Sao Paulo. 1 hour before boarding the plane I was told the flight was oversold, therefore they would have to send me on a direct trip with another airline. They offered a monetary compensation to people who were interested in changing their flight. When I asked if I was going to receive that too, they said no because my flight was leaving in an hour, which was a lie because it ended up leaving 3 hours after the original one. The new flight was taking me to a different airport which was 45 km (27 miles) away from the original one. That was a major inconvenience for me. They told me they would take care of my baggage internally with the other company. When I arrived to Buenos Aires my luggage never appeared. I spoke with people from both companies but no one knew anything. I demanded to speak with a supervisor, who made a call and found out that my luggage was in Aeroparque, the original Airport which I was supposed to arrive to. In the end they sent me in a cab to Aeroparque to get my luggage but they did not take responsibility over anything, didn't give me any compensation and not even an apology. I don't recommend anyone to use this airline, don't waste your money with them. ",Solo Leisure,December 2017,Miami to Rio de Janeiro,Economy Class,1.0,5.0,,,1.0,1,no

racket to extort extra money,Philip Ewen,2018-01-08,LATAM Airlines,Trip Verified," Sydney to Auckland. Typical disorganised South American airline. If you can put up with late departure, poor web features and poor options with dealing with their tardiness then knock your self out and buy a Latam ticket. I flew with them a few months back and even though on line check in is available it's basically useless get ready for a round the corner wait at the airport. Even so then I noted to self do not fly Latam again I bought the same route again. Received an email today flight is delayed 7 hours! Ok so please book me on another airline. Sorry we have a flight next day so can't do. Ok please book me on the next day. Sorry fully booked. Please refund me sorry that will cost you $120. All this over a phone line that sounds like it's connected through a fish pond. Every time I called the same appalling audio quality. Then you get sent ""offers"" and are asked to use their app. Virtually none of these features work. You can't sign up as it will not accept your passport number. Most of the links do not work on other features. Hence the very frustratiing conversation through the fish pond. Can I speak to a supervisor.

"airplanes were old, dirty, loud",D Sawyer,,LATAM Airlines,Trip Verified,"  Galapagos to Quito. We arrived at the airport at Baltra several hours early. Shortly before the aircraft was to take off, many of the passengers confronted the ground crew at the gate. The passengers had received emails to indicate that the flight had been canceled. The ground crew were unaware. We waited in line for hours to find out about a flight the next day. We had to go back by bus, ferry and bus to Puerto Ayora to be registered into a hotel. We were told to wait a half hour for a bus to take us to dinner but it was over an hour. We ate dinner at 10 PM. The hotel they chose lost electricity before we went to bed. The whole operation was poorly managed. We lost an entire day. While waiting to take off on the revised flight the next morning, some passengers were offered compensation while others were not. We were not.

"nice staff, no delays",V Skelden,2017-12-18,LATAM Airlines,Trip Verified,"  Cusco to Lima. We were already warned for the fact that LATAMAirlines asks tourist to pay a higher rate for a domestic flight within Peru. When booking the flight on the English website, it was indicated that we could buy the second fare rate. I do not remember the 3 options (cheapest, a bit more expensive and highest rate), but indeed we saw that we were not able to book the cheapest flight as this is only for Peruvian nationals.  After booking the flight and a happy check in at Cusco airport, a staff informed us about the fact that we booked a Peruvian fare ticket. I explained her the fact that we already knew. She showed us the Spanish webiste of Latam which is different from the English version. There it said that tourist can only buy the highest rate. This is not clear on the English website, besides that, the English website asks a few times for you nationality and passport number, so it could also have warned us. Which would be more customer friendly. After lengthy discussions, where staff even indicated that we are stupid and made a mistake, that was not a pleasant experience. We were able to not pay the fine of USD 177 (insane amount!) but the difference between the fares. She did not show us the calculation we just had to pay USD 121 in total. This is not a fair treatment as we already paid a higher fare for our tickets to Lima. ",Couple Leisure,December 2017,Sao Paulo to Paris CDG,Economy Class,2.0,4.0,,,1.0,1,no

However, once that was over, boarding was efficient, cabin and seats comfy and IFE good (although not was varied as when was only LAN). We left on time and after crossing the Andes it was time for the new dinner service. This is a radical change with one main dish (30 % larger than the norm) accompanied by a bread roll and a biscuit. Choice of 3 - meat, fish or vegetarian. Food was excellent. Overnight there was a larder in the rear galley with drinks, sandwiches and ice cream. You could also ask for eye shades, ear plugs, travel socks or a tooth brush and toothpaste. Breakfast was a choice of hot omelette or sweet pancake accompanied by yogurt or fresh fruit.

very poor service received,C Jackson,2017-11-29,LATAM Airlines,Trip Verified," This was not the first time that I have flown with LATAM. However, this is by far the worst experience I have had with any airline in the past. We intentionally purchased two tickets with a long layover in Bogota, Colombia from San Andres to Cali, Colombia. However, when we arrived at the airport in San Andres for our return flight, we found out that they had given up our seats without our volunteering nor did they offerer any incentive. We let them know that we paid more than double the price for the tickets in order to have a longer layover. However, the representative tried to force us on the plane with a direct flight to Cali. We asked to speak to a manager, however he never arrived and the representative called for the police. The police officer was polite. However, she kept telling us that there was nothing that the airline could do. We waited over 3 hours to be placed on a flight with another airline, where we had a shorter layover in Bogota. However, once we arrived and rushed to the terminal, we found out the flight had been delayed. In Bogota the service was better considering it was an inconvenience and had we known about the layover earlier, we could have made arrangements to continue the original plans we had for Bogota. I would also like to mention, this is not the first time that there have been delays in Bogota as this seems to now be the norm. I am accustomed to airlines offering incentives to volunteer seats, never have I been involuntarily removed from a flight and had a police officer try to force me on another one.",Couple Leisure,November 2017,Santiago to Buenos Aires,Economy Class,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,1,no

Aircraft was clean, but service not up to par! Most pax went to sleep as the flight was delayed, the first meal we were offered was breakfast an hour before landing, solid 10 hours after we took off.

Was expecting a substantial breakfast as it was the only meal served but was disappointed.They provided a duvet which you could use either to lay down or as blanket? The business class seats are in 2-3-2 lay out, and extremely narrow though they were lye flat.

Very old aircraft,Russell Gregory,2017-11-19,LATAM Airlines,Trip Verified," 
Flew Santiago to Easter Island. The Dreamliner we flew on both ways seemed very new and clean. The seats were comfortable and had adequate legroom to avoid knee scraping, though maybe that’s because I’m not unusually tall. The IFE was pretty good with a reasonable selection of films and TV and a video screen that was clean and unscratched. The food was quite good for economy. On the way out it was morning and we were given breakfast of an omelette and “roast potatoes”. The potatoes were a bit under-roasted but the omelette was good. The flight back was in the afternoon and we were given lunch, which again was good and this time came with wine if you wanted it. After the stewardess had collected the empty trays, she returned offering “water, juice, tea, coffee, whisky.” “Er, did you say whisky?” Yes! And I got a generous glass of Ballantines. The LATAM staff we encountered were all very helpful and friendly. Although I didn’t notice at the time, seats were allocated as soon as you have paid for the ticket, so presumably on a first come, first serve basis.

do not fly Latam,P Hosen,2017-11-11,LATAM Airlines,My lover bought a ticket for me from Lima to Arequipa. At the time of booking the price was the same for both. Before she was directed to the page she had to put the numbers of the identity documents of both. With other airlines knowing that the passenger is a foreigner the final price goes up automatically (if that is the company's policy towards foreigners). The overhead warning for foreigners is not visible enough and should be automatically charged on the part of the payment. A couple next to us also had the same problem and it does not feel right to have to pay $177 extra at the airport when you are convinced that what you paid already covers the whole service. It seems to be a fairly common problem and must be solved because I am totally disappointed with this experience with LATAM. From the beginning the page should not allow foreigners to buy a ticket at a price that does not correspond to them.,"  Pucallpa to Lima. LATAM, previously LAN in Peru, used to be an excellent airline but their service has deteriorated significantly in the last year. The latest sign of their downward spiral is the increase in flight delays and cancellations. They are constantly delaying domestic flights, almost on a whim, and display no regret or sincere apology to their paying customers. The personnel is entitled, condescending and rude, treating customers like inconveniences.  Not to mention that they charge for everything. I've tried to remain with them out of loyalty to LAN and in hopes that they might show the high quality of customer service as they did in the past, but I believe it's time to move on.

This is not a fair treatment,Sam Child,2017-10-28,LATAM Airlines,,"  Rio de Janeiro to Foz do Iguacu. This was the absolute worst airline I have flown with. My Brazilian friend and I had plans to go to Iguassu Falls together. She lives in Rio and was just going to go straight to the airport there. I was in Florianopolis and I was going to fly into Rio and then catch the same flights as my friend to go Iguassu Falls. I bought both of our tickets. My flight to Rio was a little bit late so I had to run to my gate and check-in there. I went to the gate, gave them my flight details with the code on it and gave them my passport. They printed off a ticket, gave it to me, and asked where the passenger was (my friend). She hadn't checked in yet. I asked them if they could call her on the intercom to see if she was even in the airport, they couldn't/wouldn't. My phone wasn't working and so I couldn't call her. I waited and waited until the last possible minute to board. She didn't show up (which was weird because around 5 hours earlier when I had an internet connection she told me that she was heading to the airport). I decided to board the plane and see if maybe we could get her on a later flight that same day. I got to the Iguassu Falls airport and I tried to get a hold of her. I called Latam and the airport in Rio and they couldn't give me any information. I tried calling her and it wasn't going through, so I decided to go to the hotel where I would at least have free wifi to try and call her. When I got to my room I was finally able to talk to her. Apparently she got to the airport around the same time I did and tried to check-in, but someone had already checked in as her? That's when I looked closely at my ticket, they gave me my friends ticket! How that was possible I don't know because I gave them my passport. I am very much American with a very American name and my friend is very Brazilian with a very Brazilian name. My friend was even held in Airport Security until they could verify that she really was her. They weren't even able to get her on another flight or give me a refund.  When I got back to the US I called Latam to try and get a refund for my friends ticket since we weren't able to use it. The first guy said that he wasn't authorized to give me a refund, so he said a different representative would call me in a few hours to review my case with me (whatever that means). Someone did call back a few hours later who spoke very little English and was not able to help me at all. This was a total lack of security on there part.

The airplane should take off at 11:30 a.m. Therefore, we arrieved at the Aeroparque airport very early. We were informed that this flight was delayed. When this flight appeared on the screen with the departure time at 00:30 p.m., we went to the queue. We stayed there, waiting to board, for a long time. Without any information. Absolutly none. When we asked about, the answer was always the same ""we don't know. In 20 minutes, we will give you news"". We were tired and hungry and the ""news"", did not come. Finally we learned that aircraft had technical problens. It was around 3 p.m. I and my sister paid for a lunch. Later LATAM reported that the flight had been canceled. No information was announced using a microphone or by an employee, to direct passengers. The news we had, was from the information desk and from other passengers. Finally they told us, the flight was canceled. They offered a snack ticket to passengers. This ticket was for a spoiled salad. I and my sister didn't eat it. Information was very mismatched. We had to cancel our check in, return to immigration and pick up our luggage. The airport staff were angry and treated us poorly. At night we went to a hotel. But we had to wait for the driver who would take us to Ezeiza airport at 00:30 a.m. In the Ezeiza airport we had to do the check in again. On both flights, JJ8008 when we went form Guarulhos to Buenos Aires and the back JJ9604, replacing the JJ8009, we were served bread that was clearly stale. We were completly tired, without comfort and lost our bus from São Paulo to Londrina. Besides of this, we had to pay a fee to rebook the bus tickets. I' m very, very disappointed with LATAM.

cabin and seats comfy and IFE good,J Fairrie,2017-10-04,LATAM Airlines,,"  Lima to Quito. My wife and I travelled from UK to Lima on 25 June staying overnight in Lima where we checked in on-line for our flight to Quito the following day and printed our boarding passes. On arrival at the airport at 0645 for a 0900 departure we tried to do one bag drop. We were refused entry to the bag drop queue and were ordered to go and book another ticket. No reason was given. We believe the flight was overbooked and we were singled out because we were foreign. LATAM sales then demanded we purchase a full fare return ticket, even though we showed the Sales Agent we had a valid return ticket. We had flown to South America for a once in a lifetime visit to Galapogos. We had no choice but to pay a hugely inflated price for a ticket we had already purchased. We were told by LATAM sales management in Quito we should be refunded our improperly sold ticket. On check-in at Quito, the check-in Manager used our originally purchased tickets for the flight. We have made a formal complaint to LATAM on our return to UK twice, no refund permitted. Daylight robbery. Shockingly bad.

nice full-flat seats,T Peck,2017-09-29,LATAM Airlines,,"  LATAM still needs to do more to recognise OneWorld elite members and business class passengers to become a premium airline, especially its domestic ground/airport staff. Services for OneWorld elite and business class passengers do not seem to be their culture. Flight from London to São Paulo was pleasant. The seat was not lie flat but comfortable. Old 2-2-2 layout. Food good. Nightmare started when landing in Sao Paulo transiting to Rio. The LATAM connection line from T3 Int’l to T2 domestic had more than 300 people queuing, all coming from different morning flights, but there was no priority check in for business class passengers or OneWorld emerald members. The priority was for physically disadvantaged only. The ground staff was unhelpful. Passengers choked at this point but the staff was unable to advice or redirect us. In fact people can go to T2 for a short walk upstairs to check in there too instead of waiting at these connection desks between T3&T2 for 3 hours. Encountered similar situations for the next 3 more domestic flights again. The LATAM check in priority lanes for OneWorld elite members had no English signage and accepted all passengers. The check in at CGH domestic took more than an hour. The “preferential” boarding lanes were there but often not in use. In spite of these observations, LATAM flights are generally very good and on time, and I have met so many amazing and helpful LATAM staff in São Paulo and Rio airports and in flights.",Solo Leisure,September 2017,SYD to AKL,Business Class,2.0,1.0,,,1.0,5,yes
involuntarily removed from a flight,P Huang,2017-09-18,LATAM Airlines,,"  Sydney to Auckland. This has to be my best Business Class flight to date. From what I saw at Check In, it was slightly confusing for some passengers as there was no clear signs indicating where to line up, plus the Business queue took a bit longer then necessary. After I passed security and passport control, I went  to the Qantas Business Lounge for breakfast. Flight did not depart until 11:10 am but we boarded 1 hour prior to departure. Once onboard, the service was incomparable to any Business Class service I've had to date. Crew were friendly and engaging. They offered to take pictures for me and I was the only passenger to be offered champagne. The 787-9 Business Cabin was spacious with plenty of room to move around, though I prefer a 1-2-1 layout, I think the 2-2-2 form was adequate for short journeys. The food offered was above average and though I prefer a menu, I can understand that it was only a 2.5 hour flight and having one was not necessary. IFE was had good options but not on par with Qantas or Emirates. Overall, a great first experience with Latam plus the plane itself was very quiet which made the journey calm and relaxing.",Solo Leisure,September 2017,Johannesburg to Sao Paulo,Business Class,2.0,2.0,,,1.0,8,yes
service not up to par,S Thomas,2017-09-06,LATAM Airlines,,"  Flew Sao Paulo to London Heathrow. I rather expected the flight attendants on a BA codeshare to be more prepared to speak English. After boarding a FA addressed me in rapid Portuguese and, when I asked for ""English?"" she simply shook her head and addressed the passenger in the seat adjacent to me. This seemed to be something relevant to our seating arrangements, so I was slightly uncomfortable at being shut out of the loop. Later in the flight the same FA gave me water after I asked for ""a glass of wine."" I understand I was travelling from Brazil, but since British Airways had put their name to the flight I had hoped fluency in English could be expected. In our (mostly gesticulatory) communications the FAs were very pleasant, mind, and so I suspect this is more to lay at OneWorld/BAs door than LATAMs.",Business,September 2017,Madrid to Sao Paulo,Economy Class,3.0,2.0,,,2.0,5,no
Plane needs to be updated,Niels Petersen,2017-09-05,LATAM Airlines,,"  Sydney to Auckland. LATAM is using a wide-body jet on this route and thus offers a long haul business class with an appealing cabin design and a 2x2x2 seating arrangement. The seats can be turned into a full flat bed. The service was friendly and attentive. One small, but tasty meal was served: I had a salmon quiche, a salad and a cake for desert. One point I did not like was that the cabin was held rather dark for a short day flight, and it seems that this is controlled centrally in a B787 because the windows are darkened automatically.

The seat was alright, not as cramped as Air France B777 nor as big a TAP A330. The IFE was a big disappointment, as there were very few movies and songs available. It was a night flight and I could sleep relatively well. The food portions were very small. I would fly again as long as they offer better fares.

mediocre service and quality,J Cooper,2017-08-16,LATAM Airlines,,"  Buenos Aires to Iguazu. If you fly with Latam arrive at least 3 hours in advance even for domestic flights. I arrived 1hr 45 mins in advance and was put onto a later flight- no explanation, I can guess because the flight was overbooked. I asked to speak to a supervisor to discuss the change and they refused to send me one. The response was 'it doesn't matter you have a flight' - I suggest it does matter, this has now affected my onward journey. After getting my boarding card, I had to join a two hour long check in queue. I have flown from many airports across the world, this by far is the most chaotic,stressful and experience.

When I asked the Latam agent what the problem was she replied ""What do you expect, its vacation season"". All of this hour and forty minute wait, despite having checked in online the day before. No bag drop available. The flight was then delayed almost four hours. To Latam's credit, we were given a voucher for a sandwich and soft drink. Once on board, wasn't expecting smiles but was expecting apologies from the captain and crew for the delayed flight - never happened. Food for sale on board.

Then my mother had a problem with her visa, so she couldn't travel the second date, They put her on a waiting list for a third time. The day of the flight she was assisted to her seat, but it was the wrong seat, so my mother was removed to her right seat which it was already taken.

they cancel my flight twice,S Simpson,2017-07-16,LATAM Airlines,," Great plane, woeful service from Sydney to Rio de Janeiro via Auckland and Santiago. The only good thing about my LATAM experience was the plane on the Auckland-Santiago route. Great plane, clean, modern, great technology and comfortable. The booking process was painful with multiple problems on the which continued when I tried to book a vegetarian meal (Painful and lenghthy experience) and check in online (website malfunctioning). The first leg Sydney - Auckland was with Jetstar who LATAM seemed to have not informed them that I had connecting flights and the counter staff had no idea how to deal with this, and the gave me a boarding pass for the Santiago leg and said to go to the transit, which I did and then found out that my baggage was lost in the airport. Jetstar staff all gone and LATAM staff had no idea or ability to contact Jetstar, but this was eventually sorted out. The food on the flight was pretty horrible, cold soggy uninteresting meals. Staff were nice though. when I got to Santiago it was on time but the chaos and confusion in the airport the LATAM desk overrun with angry peopel shouting, people jumping the queue staff confused and people missing connecting flights etc - it was awful. Eventually after two hours of that mess I got my boarding pass then the next plane was delayed by over two hours with no LATAM staff available or interested to help. The gate staff were overwhelemed with crowds of angry and frustrated people in overcrowded gates with so much chaos, in a filthy airport that just was not coping with the volume.

Being Peruvian she paid less. Being a tourist I had to pay a complete fare but my ticket was refundable. I had to cancel my trip. I telephoned Latam a month in advance and they assured me there was no problem and asked me to wait 4 weeks to get the refund. Nothing happened. So I called back in April and they said the ticket had already been refunded to my credit card. I checked and this was not true. Called again and they told me it was an error. They were going to investigate and gave me a new ""case"" number. Another month and no news. Finally they changed again my ""case"" number and promised to solve the problem.

Pilot needed to cancel the take off twice due to ""technical problems"" with the aircraft. Aircraft set on the tarmac for over three hours to be repaired, just to return to the gate again after having undertaken a second take off attempt. The problem was apparently not solved. Eventually the flight was cancelled completely and passengers were requested to disembark. No information from the ground staff and what is going on, and even worse, all the information that were given were only given in Portuguese language. Please note that this was an international flight from an international airport. Not acceptable. All in all this was a horrible trip with an unprofessional and incapable airline that has cost me almost a full day of my vacation. Two out of ten for LATAM organizing a decent hotel and snacks and drinks without further hassle and for the decent in-flight entertainment that helped passing the time (if it was operational, on some seats it froze and thus seized operation).

very disappointed with LATAM,Robert Stainton,2017-07-05,LATAM Airlines,,"  Santiago to Montevideo. LATAM's customer service agents are either very poorly trained, have been assigned no real decision-making authority, or both. The result is that the simplest, most reasonable and most straightforward request, if it happens not to appear in their manual, is denied. Yes, with a polite apology, and even with recognition of how very unfair it is to deny the request. But denied it is. My own experience involved making a typo on my Smartphone on their online reservation system. Booking a flight for my niece, I clicked on the wrong date. I couldn't fix it online even though I caught it within five minutes, so I phoned. First level of customer service: ""That's too complicated for us"". Escalated to second level of customer service: ""I'm not authorized to change that"". Escalated to third level of customer service: ""What you request is very reasonable, but I will need to forward the case to my supervisor"". The Supervisor then didn't get back to us until after the (incorrect) flight had taken place. I was out $300 and my niece was denied her trip.

it was very dirty,Harold Bush-Howard,,LATAM Airlines,,"  Lima to Santiago de Chile. Very good inflight attention by excellent cabin crew but service let down by very poor quality of food (a snack), and also by indifferent ground attention at Lima airport. For a place with such a big operation it is extraordinary they do not provide a lounge for premium passengers. I was in transit and no one told me of this change so I went to the lounge I used them last time I flew with them, only to be told to go miles away to gate 21 to get a voucher, but on arrival there was told to go back from where I started and take lift downstairs to collect it. No effort was made to make things easy for a passenger or to remedy the inconvenience they caused by not telling me anurjign, someone who paid a lot to travelling business with them.

had hoped fluency in English could be expected,W Robert Kmen,2017-06-06,LATAM Airlines,,"  For a flight from Madrid to Frankfurt, I cannot imagine that service on LH or IB even comes close to what LATAM offers. This 787 aircraft arrives in Madrid from Santiago, Chile and continues on to Frankfurt. This is a true international business class product with full lie-flat seats and catalog of AVOD. The crew was outgoing and personable, the meal-snack was delicious, and the Chilean sparkling wine was delicious. My only caveat to a perfect flight was that LATAM does not fund the use of passport and security fast track on this route. That would not be a problem if they informed business class passengers of this anomaly at check-in. This would avoid the embarrassment of being turned away. Except for this, the flight was perfect.

Onboard service is excellent, crew superior to many other airlines. Food ok but could be better. IFE excellent but unchanged programmes from my last flights in February. My only complaint is that after all the hype over the Dreamliner, I find the economy class seats incredibly narrow, hard, uncomfortable and impossible to sleep. The mood lighting might be great, the air quality better, cabin pressure improved, but someone's forgotten about seat comfort.

service level is getting worse,P Muller,2017-05-30,LATAM Airlines,,"  Sao Paulo to Iguazu Falls. The flight was ok apart from the tired cabin. I am an aircraft engineer and it was not in good shape. However this was not the problem as I expected this standard. The problem was changing an existing ticket using the helpdesk telephone number. If you ever find you need to change your ticket over the telephone then DON'T. I tried for 12 hours on and off, sat on a supermarket pay phone in Argentina and got nowhere at all. I was told each time that I would be contacted to give me a new price. Every time I called it was the same answer...where would you like to fly, we can not help until you are contacted by the specialist department, you must wait etc. I had a sleepless night in my hostel not knowing if I had a flight and unable to arrange alternative plans until I knew. Over 12 hours to resolve a simple flight booking change? Which did not get resolved at all. Frustration is not the word. I will not use this airline again.

The seat was alright,Werner Stander,2017-05-28,LATAM Airlines,,"  Santiago to Sao Paolo. Absolute disaster. We were delayed in Santiago due to crew not being on time arriving 40 min late. Then in flight we requested to be assisted for notifying SAA of delay and priority disembarkment.  At Sao Paolo ground crew took 20 mins to open the plane door.  No assistance from there, no notification to anyone in Sao Paulo. We missed our flight to Johannesburg. When requesting a letter from confirmation of delay, not even any offer for accomodation. LATAM staff didn't even bother to find out why the plane was delayed. The worst airline I have ever used by far. LATAM are incompetent and cannot accomodate international travelers. Their staff has no clue of how to treat clients and assist. For example the captain does an anouncement about a delay without even repeating it in English.

I would never fly LATAM again,L Gadeem,2017-05-25,LATAM Airlines,,"  Cusco to Talara via Lima. LATAM is terrible and unhelpful when it comes to service. We were flying from Cusco to Talara via Lima. Our flight from Cusco to Lima was delayed, and thus we arrived at the gate of our 2nd flight during last call. The attendants at the gate was unapologetic, said it was Cusco airport's fault, said no compensation except to book another flight at another airport. Firstly, no apology. Saying sorry and empathizing would calm our nerves. No compensation for this situation nor assistance navigating the airport security where we had to explain to security why we have to reclaim our baggage. This is LATAM airlines fault. They had no sense of urgency or willingness to help. We spoke to the flight attendants on our flight from Cusco to Lima to assist us to request to let the gate know that our flight is leaving right when we were landing and all they said was oh it will be fine talk to the people at the gate it doesn't take long to get to the gate. They didn't even have the courtesy to let the gate know we were coming, knowing we were running desperately to catch this flight. My friends and I ran through the airport, pushed out way past security and made last call but didn't make our connecting flight. I think as passengers, my friends and I we did everything we could do ensure we make our connecting flight but Latam airlines and all the employees we were in contact with did not have the sense of urgency or the commitment to providing the best service possible to ensure we get to our flights; instead we received such substandard, unsatisfactory and negligent service.

LATAM priority boarding area and Lounge made pre-boarding extremely simple, fast and pleasant. Boarding happened smoothly, the 2-2-2 layout of LATAM Premium Business is not ideal as you might (if you are on a window seat as I was) be forced to climb over the passanger next to you to go to the toilet. Still seats very wide and comfortable; the flight was only 2 hours long, but pillows and duvet were distributed for those wanting to take a nap and the seat seemed comfortable enough to get a decent sleep. Service was extremely attentive - even for such a short flight - and included a full breakfast on white tablecloth and china; overall the crew was very nice and friendly, always called by name each of the passangers and walked that extra-mile that makes a flight really enjoyable these days.

my niece was denied her trip,L Mallin,2017-04-12,LATAM Airlines,,"  Buenos Aires to Sydney via Santiago. Over the past 9 years my I have flown with Lan airlines more that 16 times around South America and from Australia to South America. This, however was our first trip with them as LATAM. Never again! Lan and Tam as separate companies were always amazing once you got on the flight. The service outside of that, was never that good. However, now it is impossible to deal with them. Also, the standard of the inflight service has dropped dramatically. Both airlines used to be something i would recommend and boast about to friends coming to visit me in South America. I will just list the problems we had with a return flight from Melbourne to Buenos Aires and then a return flight from Buenos Aires to Sao Paulo. The wrong flight departure times given for first leg of the flight (out buy 4 hours), tried to call customer service with wait times of over 45 minutes and then it would just disconnect. Called with a 2 hour wait time and the person on the other end giving the incorrect information. With language skills not proficient in Portuguese or English. Lost Luggage on two flights  The seat we reserved 9 months in advanced was not valid as I have an Australian passport and can not be verified until i arrive for that flight. The check-in managers response was ""we have this problem with every flight to Auckland and Sydney. We get so many complaints. The company have no interest in fixing this problem"" Flight delayed for over an hour without updating anyone. When I asked if they could just make an announcement so all the people waiting knew what was happening they just looked at me as if I had asked them to fly me on their back to my destination. On a leg of the flight that was over 3 hours the only food was a sandwich labelled ""vegi"" with cream cheese and some unidentified vegetable (only an assumption that it was a vegetable). When asked for the sandwich we could see other people opposite us eating we were told we are sitting on the other side of the plan so we can't have that one. Took 4 weeks to process the purchase of a ticket with lanpass points, we sent an email saying because they had changed out departure time we could change are return time/date with no additional cost. tried processing online and was directed to call. Tried calling gave up after 1 hour. Went into a Latam office and was told the only way it can be processed is if we call Latam and directed us to the phone. Was then told after waiting only 40 minuets for someone to answer that we could we just need to pay a small fee. However, the person calculated it incorrectly so after 1 hour of talking and clarifying he realised he didn't know what he was doing and we couldn't change our ticket. Positives The wine is good I will NEVER fly with them again. I will use Aerolineas Argentinas before them and that is saying something.  I believe now Latan feel like they can dominate the region and no longer have to impress their customers. Its such a shame.

To my surprise, the price of my ticket from Cuzco to Lima (already higher competed to the local competition) was raised by 177USD because I was not a Peruvian resident. Tourists be aware of this policy that LATAM applies to non Peruvian residents! You will end paying much more than necessary. Tickets with other carriers for the same trip go for 60-70 USD!

very poor quality of food,Rod Long,2017-03-28,LATAM Airlines,," Sydney to Buenos Aires AEP via Santiago with LATAM. Booked ages ahead for a very good fare. Chose LATAM over Air New Zealand partly due to being able to fly into AEP instead of EZE. Proved to be a good move as it's heaps closer to the centre of the city. Outbound flight was delayed (my inside knowledge says it was nearly cancelled) but we eventually left about 3 hours late. With time made up enroute and a planned long connection time in SCL we arrived on time. Checkin was easy, flight attendants pleasant and attentive and the IFE was pretty good. Food is mediocre and after a few flight you see that it's a little repetitive. We sat towards the front on the 787 which was quiet. I'd avoid sitting in the centre near the toilets or in the rear - noisy due to toilets flushing or galley. Checkin at AEP was slow. Had tried to checkin online but their system is nonsensical. The checkin agent was fantastic and we ended up in the front row on both flights. Note that the first 4 rows of Y are space+ and have 2 inches more legroom. You usually pay, but this was waived due to our whinge about the online checkin. Flights back right on time.

We found the service to be excellent, food was delicious and the entertainment was great (all the latest shows and movies). This flight was a code link with Qantas Airlines. When we had a stopover in Chile, we missed our flight to Argentina (LA 445). We met with staff member at the LATAM service desk in Santiago who helped us track our luggage and arranged for us to get on the next flight (via standby on LA443), free of charge and no issues.

not use this airline again,Jennifer Wilson,2017-02-27,LATAM Airlines,,"  We were flying from the Galapagos to Quito and then on to Lima but our flight to Quito was severely delayed. We rushed off the plane and through security to get to the gate right before the plane was to take off (note the plane had not yet left). However one of the rudest people that I have ever met working in customer service just shook her head and said go buy another ticket. Now, it was 8 pm and I was with my 2 small children and had got to the gate before the plane took off but she refused to let us on. When I asked if we could be rebooked on the next flight or the one after or if there was anything that could be done, she simply shrugged and said go buy another ticket. I am not rich by any means and can't spend thousands of dollars on another ticket for 4 people. I told her this and she said nothing. Hands down THE WORST customer service I have ever encountered. The worst part was we later found out that they had cancelled our tickets back to the US which were scheduled for 3 weeks later, effectively stranding my family in Quito, where I sit now. I have been at the airport for 2 days arguing with people to try and at least let us have the flight that we paid for and is scheduled for 3 weeks from now back to the US.

Service was extremely attentive,L Marcia,,LATAM Airlines,," Buenos Aires to Puerto Natales via Santiago. My family and me had a very bad experience with LATAM. We couldn't check-in online, and we had to do it by calling them (it took 30 minutes). Then, our flight from Buenos Aires was delayed, and we missed our connecting flight at Santiago. When we arrived at the airport, no one from the airline was there to help us expedite customs and immigration, so we missed the connecting flight. To make things worse, it was a struggle to have LATAM finally re-book us to a flight to a nearby city, where they transported us by car to our final destination. We spent 3 hours arguing with them at a check-in counter. The next day, we received an email that our return flights had been canceled, because we had not used the original connection. We had to call them again: 1.30 hours later, they finally agreed to un-cancel our return, admitting that it was their problem that the original connecting flight had been missed. The day before our return, we tried to check-in online. Of course, it didn't work. We had to call them again: they couldn't find the reservation (although they had made it themselves). Add one more hour, until they finally checked us in. On the way back, our departure was delayed because there was a maintenance problem with the plane. They didn't offer any explanations, people on the bus started complaining (they had actually driven us up to the plane and left us waiting there). The flight back to Buenos Aires finally departed and arrived 2 hours late. My advice: if you have any choice, avoid this company.

WE left Guayaquil to Galapagos on December 25 and requested that the 2 suitcases be sent to our hotel - The Wyndham in GYE as we were returning there after our Boat trip to the islands. The hotel desk called in Spanish while we were incommunicado on the boat, LATAM Airlines emailed us on the 27th December to say they had sent the cases to Baltra - against all common sense and asked what hotel we are at.

I peeped to see what was going on and the crew was on their laptop playing some game. They were visibly embarrassed that some of us noticed them so they put on a charm offensive which did not last long. More than half an hour after take off and well after the seat belt signs were out they still had not open the front toilet. I was in 1A and was hoping to use it but could not ask them to open it because they had by now congregated in the back galley. Eventually they said I had to use the rear toilet because they needed to do a 'security procedure' (which was to feed the pilot and co-pilot). After this they still did not open the toilet and then congregated In the front galley chatting away very loudly with the curtain drawn as if we passengers were irrelevant to them. They seat belts signs then went on for the rest of the flight. They looked delighted because they just sat and chantted away and did not have to hand out food or drinks to us.

It was fine for this four-hour flight, but I’m not sure I would choose it for a 12+ hour flight. Check-in at Santiago Airport was a bit confusing. Although this is a domestic flight, check in is not handled by the domestic check-in counters.

a low cost airline in terms of service,M Gough,,LATAM Airlines,,"  Arequipa to Cusco. I purchased two tickets from LATAM Airlines website for $138. Then when I arrived at the airport their agent said there is a penalty fee of $354 ($177 each). I asked why and they said since I'm not Peruvian I have to pay the penalty. First off, why even let me purchase tickets online, charge my card, and send me my confirmation and itinerary if you are going to charge me double at the airport? Then I asked for a refund on my tickets which was denied. So you're going to up charge me with sneaky hidden fees and then deny a refund for my original ticket when I can't afford the up charge. This can't be legal. Now they had me trapped. I couldn't afford the $354 up charge and told the agent that. She said she could drop the penalty to $154. Still trapped with no option I said, ""sure, what other choice do I have?"". Either lose $136 and have no flight or pay the extra charge. After the aweful flight I opened a customer service claim online to attempt to get a refund for then extra money they charged and I got terrible customer service and was stonewalled as they closed the case without ever letting me respond.

exceeded our expectations,Jason Rigg,2016-12-28,LATAM Airlines,,"  Sydney to Santiago via Auckland, first time travelling business class long haul and LATAM made sure it was great. With the exception of the size of the lavatory and the ground crew in Auckland during transit, I could not nitpick anything.  I was pleasantly surprised how great the seats were for length. The lavatory lacked space and was just as cramped as any economy toilet and one member of ground staff decided to get on the phone about one thing while I was boarding holding me up. The manager did come over and tell her to hurry up as it's delaying boarding, but it was frustrating having to wait for what sounded a pointless call. But besides those two things.

great service from LATAM,P Garrido,2016-12-25,LATAM Airlines,,"  Flew from Santiago to Florianopolis on LATAM's A320-200. Check-in was quite sluggish, as there were only two or three counters open with about five planes checking in at the same time. Ground staff was friendly though, so I wasn't particularly bothered with the check-in process. You could tell right of the bat that the plane was quite old, as each armrest was equipped with an ashtray. Despite this, the aircraft was fairly clean and well kept. The seats were also quite comfortable, with great legroom and a generous amount of recline. Despite the airplane not having personal entertainment screens, I downloaded the LATAM Entertainment app on my phone, which allowed me to watch movies, TV shows, and look at a flight map. On the flight, we were served a sandwich, a croissant, fruit, and a choice of drink for breakfast. I was surprised to see real cutlery for each meal tray, which is something I rarely see. The crew aboard this flight was friendly as well, and responded do the flight attendant bell quickly.

"service was normal, nothing outstanding",S Finola,2016-12-24,LATAM Airlines,,  ES: Mi enamorada compró un pasaje para mi desde Lima to Arequipa. Al momento de hacer la reserva el precio era el mismo para ambos. Antes de que fuera direccionada a la página ella tuvo que poner los números de los documentos de identidad de ambos. Con otras aerolíneas al saber que el pasajero es un extranjero el precio final sube automáticamente (si esa es la política de la empresa para con extranjeros). El aviso de sobrecarga para extranjeros no es suficientemente visible y debería ser cargada automáticamente en la parte del pago. Una pareja a nuestro lado también tuvo el mismo problema y no se siente bien tener que pagar US$ 177 extra en el aeropuerto cuando estás convencido de que lo que pagaste ya comprendía todo el servicio. Parece que es un problema bastante común y debe ser solucionado porque estoy totalmente decepcionado con esta experiencia con LATAM. Desde un principio la página no debería debería permitir que extranjeros compren un pasaje a un precio que no les corresponde.   EN: My lover bought a ticket for me from Lima to Arequipa. At the time of booking the price was the same for both. Before she was directed to the page she had to put the numbers of the identity documents of both. With other airlines knowing that the passenger is a foreigner the final price goes up automatically (if that is the company's policy towards foreigners). The overhead warning for foreigners is not visible enough and should be automatically charged on the part of the payment. A couple next to us also had the same problem and it does not feel right to have to pay $177 extra at the airport when you are convinced that what you paid already covers the whole service. It seems to be a fairly common problem and must be solved because I am totally disappointed with this experience with LATAM.

avoid them at all costs,J Delaney,2016-12-19,LATAM Airlines,,"  Punta Arenas to Santiago. Worst flying experience I've had, and it was on my honeymoon, sadly enough. Our flight was to leave at 4 am. We boarded the plane and waited in our seats for over an hour - no communication as to why there was a delay on take off. After an hour and a half of waiting we were told the flight had been cancelled because the plane was having engine troubles. They told us they didn't know when it would be rescheduled for, so we just had to wait. Then, 4 hours later, we found out the flight was rescheduled (to 12 hours after it was supposed to take off.) I talked to multiple people who said LATAM wouldn't let them switch to one of the earlier flights going to the same destination, even though there were seats available, so they missed their connections. When checking in for the rescheduled flight- there was 1 employee working doing check-in and bag drop, while 50 people waited in line. (and “conveniently"" the electronic check-in wasn't working that day either.) At one point, nobody was at the front desk for over 20 minutes, while the line continued to get longer. We were given ""vouchers"" since the flight was cancelled, which equalled 7,000 pesos or about $10 USD only to be used on a sandwich or NA beverage, and of course they were out of sandwiches and could only be used at the cafes outside of the gate area, so everyone had to go through security again just to get their ""free"" coffee. Wouldn't have been a big deal if it wasn't the cherry on top of a very long day. It was the slowest, most unorganized airport I have ever seen. I was told to expect an email with information about a $50 reimbursement. It's been almost a week and haven't received that email yet. Furthermore, $50 is not even close to enough considering we lost an entire day of our honeymoon because of this flight. Fortunately these things happen rarely. But when they do, it is the airport's responsibility to their customers to make it right and reimburse for the wasted time and inconvenience it has caused.

LATAM Airlines used to be a reference when it was Tam Airlines, unfortunetely the service nowadays is poor. The boarding process at Frankfurt Airport was confusion, they tried to create lines per rows at the gate, but they failed. The flight took off on time, then they started the service, there was two options of dishes for dining (pasta and meat) and only one option for breakfast (Sandwich). Drinks options were very limited.

flight of regular quality,George Justo,2016-12-13,LATAM Airlines,,"  Recife to London via Sao Paulo. I have travelled to Brazil many times before but this is the first time I chose LATAM. I thought the connection would be easier by using the LATAM. However this was a mistake. First of all, I have only 1:45 minutes connection time, and the plane was late about 30 minutes. I was told by the crew not to worry. Arriving in São Paulo, it took us almost half hour to leave the plan and get the bus. I understand problems may happen. However the lack of information or assistance from the crew, not even to confirm the gate number or whether I had to change terminal, was unacceptable. I was told by the arrogant senior steward that the ground staff would help. Arriving at the terminal there was nobody from the airline to help with international connection, as suggested; the available staff did not speak English and was only guiding domestic connecting passengers. To make it worse the airport was poorly signed. The only people who really helped me were the duty free ladies. I had to run to terminal 3 and just made the flight. I tried to complained at the gate to the supervisor but she did not speak any English and did not bother apologising. On board, feeling tired and distressed I asked for a cup of water and was served by a very arrogant and unhelpful stewardess. Luckily, I had some very strong sleeping pills, which I took and only woke up in London when the whole LATAM nightmare was finally over.

They compel everyone to use them, and staff has not been well trained. You are strongly instructed to do. No smile, no explanations. Therefore you should expect shorter lines for dropping. Lines are huge, because they already closed many check-in stations. It took me more than 45mn to drop a single luggage. They also decided that Rimowa and Louis Vuitton bags should be dropped in a special place as they are ""very expensive items in case of damage"". The whole process was crazy. A321 is a high density aircraft now, with small pitch. I paid R$30,00 for emergency exit, with a lot of space. I should not be allowed to do so, as I am older than 60 and they refuse 60 years old people on emergency exits. As far as I paid, they did not check my age.

In this relatively short trip of 5 hours the only good thing about business class is the lie flat seat, although it is in a 2-2-2 configuration and very old. Apart from that, everything else was really poor as seems to be the case with LATAM business class lately.

"irresponsible, indifferent and careless",Roger Tilling,2016-10-08,LATAM Airlines,," London Heathrow to Sao Paulo with LATAM. It was my second return trip this year on this route. Both journeys were consistent, and in a good way. Their boarding starts about an hour before departure for all classes, which speeds up departure times. The business class cabin does have a seven-abreast configuration (2-3-2) and I certainly wouldn’t want to be a passenger in the middle of the three in the centre. Luckily, I had a window seat (1A outbound and 2K inbound). The seat is comfortable, the food courses are served all at once on one tray (which is a let-down for business class) and the cabin crew is very efficient. The seat isn’t fully flat, but despite being 6ft 5ins in height, I was able to get about 6 hours of sleep in both directions. The Salvatore Ferragamo amenity kit given out provides everything so get through the flight, and the toilets are kept very clean (for walking around in slipper socks). The LATAM lounge in Sao Paulo is exceptional for food, drink, showers, space and comfort, and better than many other airlines. LATAM could do with a flat-bed seat in business class, but they are really leading the way in lounges and this airline should be watched with interest as they consolidate into one brand.",Solo Leisure,October 2016,SCL to SYD,Business Class,,,,,4.0,8,yes

The most alarming issue is that while flight attendants speak English, all announcements on board are made in Brazilian Portuguese which made me worried - what language will these airlines make announcements in during emergencies? Therefore, I will prefer to fly local airlines that make announcements in English as well.",Business,August 2016,GIG to SCQ,Economy Class,,,,,2.0,6,no
World’s Best Airports in 2025,Alasdair Brooks,2016-08-29,LATAM Airlines,,"  I didn't know what to expect from LATAM, but ended up being pleasantly surprised. The flight from Heathrow to Sao Paulo was on a plane that was either newer than that on the return leg or had been refurbished, it was also emptier, so had more space for stretching out. Regardless, the multilingual staff were friendly and efficient, the in-flight entertainment better than I was expecting, and the economy class seats comfortable enough to allow me to sleep on what's an 11-hour overnight flight (in both directions). On the basis of this experience, I'd consider flying LATAM again to South America.",Business,August 2016,GYE to CUZ via LIM,Economy Class,,,,,2.0,7,yes
THE BEST AIRLINE CABIN CREW,Craig Willis,2016-08-19,LATAM Airlines,,"  
If you ever wanted to know how many people you can fit into an Airbus 320 then fly with LATAM. Flew Rio de Janeiro to Santiago for a duration of 4 hours and 35 minutes and almost needed knee surgery when I landed. The space between the seats is very limited and of course the passenger in front of me decided to recline his seat straight after take -off. Which meant little or no room for my legs. Even worse was when my neighbour needed to go to the restroom and could not get past his reclined seat after I had stood up. I asked a crew member if they could ask the passenger to raise his seat a little and was met with a smile and a no. Other than being cooped up for the duration we were served breakfast and a regular run of tea and coffee and juice. many locals in Rio told me they avoid this airline due to service or lack of it and the seating. I am certainly will look at alternatives after a rather ordinary experience.",Business,August 2016,LHR to GRU,Economy Class,,,,,3.0,3,no
LATAM Airlines Photos,Bojan Tercon,2016-08-14,LATAM Airlines,," First time flying the newly formed LATAM. On this flight from Brasilia to Manaus the plane is actually from TAM. This old A320 had an all-economy layout with quite a comfy seat. Well cushioned. Although leg room was down to a minimum. What that means is that when the person in front of you reclines their seat you have to recline as well, otherwise the seat in front of you is pretty much in your face. The meal service was simple but good. By far the best part of this flight though was the onboard mobile entertainment system that you accessed through your mobile device. Worked perfectly. Great selection of movies, TV shows, music etc. Totally impressed for this short-haul plane doesn’t require an IFE system anymore.",Couple Leisure,May 2016,,Economy Class,,,,,4.0,7,yes
recommend flying LATAM,P Merter,2016-07-18,LATAM Airlines,,"  Guayaquil to Cusco via Lima. I flew LATAM Airlines which is a OneWorld partner of Iberia. As I am a frequent flyer of Iberia, I asked LATAM to convert the miles of this flight to Iberia Avios. I did everything right during reservation and check-in and always informed about my Iberia Plus membership card number. This number was also printed on the tickets and boarding passes. I expect the transfer of miles from LATAM to Iberia to be done automatically as it happens for any airline, but in this case it did not. Since 2 months I lose my time because I have to contact Iberia, send them proof that I flew with LATAM, Iberia tells me I have to contact LATAM and LATAM tells me that I have to contact Iberia. Each time I write an email to Iberia it takes 3 weeks for them to reply to me. ",Solo Leisure,July 2016,,Economy Class,,,,,3.0,3,no
Terrible airline,Ramona Gonzales,2025-04-26,GOL Linhas Aéreas,Not Verified,"  Terrible airline. First, anyone boarding in groups 2 or above were forced to check their carry-on items even though there was room in the overhead compartments. Second, our first flight was late, so we missed our connecting flight. We were told there would be someone at our arrival gate to help us. There was no one. We stood in the ""priority line"" for at least 30 minutes before being helped with re-ticketing. Then, we went to lost luggage to find our bags. Despite the fact that we could clearly see our bags on the floor behind the agent, he told us the bags weren't there, and we'd have to go to a different location.

"Dear Gol, never again",S Marcena,,GOL Linhas Aéreas,Trip Verified,"  Absolutely the worst airline ever taken, for rudeness, incompetence and superficiality. We start from check in: online, it doesn't work! Oh well, we'll do it at the airport. The day of departure arrives, there are a lot of people who have to leave and they spread us out across several lines... It's a shame that in some of these, the relevant counters for check-in/boarding of suitcases are closed. The other lines flow, like time, but ours doesn't. Nobody does anything. Someone complains to Gol officials who pass by because they risk missing their flight and the answer is always the same ""yes, yes, now we'll intervene"", but nothing! Finally, after 40 minutes of standing still, someone deigns to work. The process begins and finally it's our turn. Unfortunately on the other side we find a blonde lady, both incompetent and unpleasant. Maybe it was because working over Easter was weighing on her, but you can't have a similar, grumpy and irritating attitude. He asks (rightly) for the documents and after a few seconds he stops because my wife, a Brazilian with a residence permit for Italy (which incidentally, she will receive citizenship the day after our arrival in Italy), does not have a return ticket in Brazil. Return? In Brazil? We explain to her that we were here on holiday and this is the flight (one of 3) returning to Italy, where we live, work and live. The operator is not, she is not convinced and needs to find out more. My wife's residence permit is given to her, but as I expected, she understands nothing about it. He reads, rereads, looks at the front, looks at the back but nothing, he doesn't understand. She gets up, goes to talk to someone who probably understands something more about her and then returns calmly and says: ok, fine (as if she were making a concession to us). The ticket includes 2 suitcases each weighing 23kg. We arrange them one after the other: the first 20kg, the second and third about 15kg, the last 25kg. The blonde stops everything again, because the maximum is 23kg. Let's try to tell her that no one had ever given us any problems, neither for Brazil nor for other destinations, for similar cases. Only one of the 4 suitcases exceeded 23kg while the others were well below, but nothing, he is adamant. If we don't distribute the excess weight into another piece of baggage, we will have to pay for the excess! And then everything stops again, the people behind us wait and we are forced to open the offending suitcase, take some clothes, transfer them to another piece of luggage and start all over again. Doubly absurd because if we had paid, the suitcase could have remained as it was, so it was clear that the extra 2 kg did not constitute any problem, but that's how it is. And again, we kindly ask her if she can sit next to us and she nods very annoyed. As if we were asking her something absurd. And what does he do? He assigns us 2 central seats, 31E and 32E, on two different rows. We look at each other and let it go, they are probably the only places available. We get on the plane and only after finishing the boarding operations, we notice that the window seat, next to mine (31E), 31F, is free. It's the wrong company, there's nothing else to say! It's the exact opposite of Azul, where everyone is competent, available, smiling. There is no comparison. Dear Gol, never again.  In assoluto la peggior compagnia aerea mai presa, per scortesia, incompetenza e superficialità. Si parte dal check in: on line, non funziona! Vabbè, lo faremo in aeroporto. Arriva il giorno della partenza, c'è moltissima gente che deve partire e ci distribuiscono su più file... Peccato che in corrispondenza di alcune di queste, i relativi sportelli per check in/ imbarco valigie, sono chiusi. Le altre file scorrono, come il tempo del resto, la nostra no. Nessuno fa nulla. Qualcuno si lamenta con funzionari Gol che passano davanti poiché rischia di perdere il volo e la risposta è sempre la stessa ""si, si, ora interveniamo"", ma nulla! Finalmente, dopo 40 minuti a fila ferma, qualcuno si degna di lavorare. Inizia la trafila e finalmente tocca a noi. Purtroppo dall'altra parte troviamo una signora bionda, con  e tanto incompetente quanto antipatica. Sarà che le stava pesando lavorare di Pasqua, ma non si può avere un atteggiamento simile, scontroso e irritante. Chiede (giustamente) i documenti e dopo pochi secondi si blocca perché mia moglie, brasiliana con permesso di soggiorno per l'Italia (che per inciso, la cittadinanza la riceverà il giorno dopo il nostro arrivo in Italia), non ha il biglietto di ritorno in Brasile. Ritorno? In Brasile? Le spieghiamo che siamo stati qui in vacanza e questo è il volo (uno dei 3) di ritorno in Italia, dove abitiamo, lavoriamo, viviamo. L'operatrice no, non è convinta e deve approfondire. Le viene consegnato il permesso di soggiorno di mia moglie, ma come prevedevo, non ne capisce nulla. Legge, rilegge, guarda il fronte, osserva il retro ma nulla, non comprende. Si alza, va a parlare con chi, probabilmente, capisce qualcosa in più di lei e poi ritorna, con calma e dice: ok, va bene (come se ci stesse facendo una concessione). Il biglietto comprende 2 valigie a testa da 23kg l'una. Le disponiamo una dietro l'altra: la prima 20kg, la seconda e la terza circa 15kg, l'ultima 25kg. La bionda, blocca tutto di nuovo, perché il massimo è 23kg. Proviamo a dirle che nessuno ci aveva mai fatto problemi, né per il Brasile né per altre destinazioni, per casi simili. Una sola delle 4 valigie superava i 23kg mentre le altre erano ampiamente al di sotto, ma niente, è irremovibile. Se non distribuiamo il peso eccedente in un altro bagaglio, dovremo pagare l'eccedenza! E allora blocca tutto di nuovo, la gente dietro di noi aspetta e noi siamo costretti ad aprire la valigia incriminata, prendere qualche vestito, trasferirlo in un altro bagaglio e ricominciare tutto da capo.  Assurdo doppiamente perché se avessimo pagato, la valigia sarebbe potuta rimanere così come era, per cui era chiaro che i 2 kg in più non costituivano alcun problema, ma tant'è. E ancora, Le chiediamo gentilmente se può metterci vicino e annuisce molto scocciata. Come se le stessimo chiedendo una cosa assurda. E cosa fa? Ci assegna 2 posti centrali, 31E e 32E, su due file diverse. Ci guardiamo e lasciamo perdere, probabilmente sono gli unici posti disponibili. Saliamo in aereo e solo dopo aver terminato le operazioni di imbarco, abbiamo modo di notare che il posto finestrino, accanto al mio (31E), il 31F, è libero. È la compagnia sbagliata, non c'è altro da aggiungere! È l'esatto contrario della Azul, dove tutti sono competenti disponibili, sorridenti. Non c'è paragone.

The flight I have now, which has a stopover in Brasilia, I will have to pay extra to book a seat in the second flight. And the same will happen when in the return flight.

Highlight is an outstanding, elegant app. The rest was all ordinary to poor. Cattle car experience boarding with zero social distancing. I had paid for a seat with extra legroom. As far as I could tell it had none and was tiny and a waste of money. Most people in those seats didn't pay for it like I did and were assigned because there were no other seats left. No overhead bin space left for me either, despite paying for it. And for those AA elites who expect benefits based on the recent AA and Gol partnership, you'll be disappointed.

What a terrible experience,Catherine V Scott,2019-10-12,GOL Linhas Aéreas,Not Verified,"  Salvador to João Pessoa. What a terrible experience, from start to finish. The kiosk, which never seems to work on other flights, once again did not work in Salvador. The line we were told to enter, ironically enough called ""assist with check-in,"" provided no assistance at all. It moved at a glacial pace, and there was no one to ask for help. Even though we arrived at the airport two hours before a domestic flight, by the time we arrived at the desk of a most unhelpful check-in ""assistant,"" and again, I use that term advisedly, we were told that we had missed the flight and needed to go to the airline ticket desk to sort things out. Just when you thought a check in assistant could be horrible, well, the airline ticket desk employee must be woefully underpaid, afflicted with a terminal illness, or about to retire. He was of absolutely no help. His solution: call Expedia and get them to buy another ticket for the following day. Hello GOL! We are here on vacation and don't have time to do that. So we wound up having to go to Azul (excellent staff, by the way) and spend 3,224 reis to buy our tickets to Joao Pessoa.

complaints line of GOL was totally inadequate,C Peeters,2019-09-28,GOL Linhas Aéreas,Trip Verified," On this flight from Manaus to Cuiaba via Brasilia we were confronted with a 4 hour delay because of a management decision of GOL: the day before they had accumulated a backlog because of bad weather. In order to purge this backlog they have decided to use the aircraft that was supposed to fly us - in time! - from Manaus to Brasilia for flying other passengers to another destination first. GOL staff do not speak Engish, we needed the help of fellow passengers who translated for us. We called the complaints line of GOL which was totally inadequate: while the delay was displayed in the airport at Manaus and was also visible through google when searching for the flight number, the GOL complaints call taker was not even aware of the delay, assuring us there was no problem. After some convincing on my part he eventually called Manaus airport to admit I'm right and I have no other option than to talk to people of GOL in Brasilia airport to learn about my options to finally get to my destination. After roughly 4 hours the aircraft returned and flew us to Brasilia eventually. As we only had 1 hour of transfer in Brasilia we obviously lost our connection to Cuiaba. As this destination is not so popular they have one flight a day, so we had to wait until the late afternoon of the next day to proceed our travel. In the meanwhile we were dumped in the sleaziest hotel of Brasilia, way out of town. I checked booking: even Brazilians are highly recommending to avoid that hotel! For dinner we received an allowance of 37 BRL, less than 10€, for 2 persons. This barely pays for a little snack, let alone dinner especially at airport prices! Because of this management decision we lost a full day of an expensive nature tour in Pantanal costing us (couple) 600€ a day!

I cannot even begin to describe how bad this airline is in terms of its scheduling reliability and the hours you waste having to spend picking up after their incompetent operations. I booked in October in what were supposed to be direct flights to Fortaleza and from that time until April, they changed departures and returns a total of 7 times and changed flights from direct to flights with connections also. In the first 2 cases because of the grounding of the 787Max, so I can forgive them for that, but not the rest, unrelated to that issue or making direct flights connecting flights. Almost impossible to reach without travel agent assistance. They so complicated our travel plans and connections with other airlines that they literally forced us to accept a refund because on the planned return date which was again subject to a change - for the third time - they had no alternative flights to prevent missing a connection even if that meant having to pay twice the fare with a US carrier to be able to get back as scheduled, Do not fly this airline.",Couple Leisure,May 2019,Miami to Fortaleza,Economy Class,4.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,4.0,1,no
flight was cancelled without explanation,Greg Demirtzoglou,2019-04-30,GOL Linhas Aéreas,Not Verified,"  My experience with GOL was absolutely terrible. My flight was cancelled without explanation (after having entered customs). I spent 3 hours trying to identify an alternative option, the staff were extremely unhelpful and poorly equipped to handle the situation. Only 1 of 8 staff members could speak broken English, and any non-Brazilian passengers were treated with disrespect. After being given 2 connecting flights to my final destination Rio, my flight was again delayed at my first layover. Our boarding gate was changed 3 times without any English notifications or announcements made. Again the staff were disrespectful to passengers. The staff were ill informed about the itinerary and were struggling to direct passengers to their respective destinations within the airport.

"Unbelievable, never again",P Harper,,GOL Linhas Aéreas,Trip Verified,"  Buenos Aires to Quito via Sao Paulo. The second leg of this flight, from Sao Paolo to Quito, was due to arrive at 22:30. Instead, it diverted without explanation or warning (at any rate which was comprehensible to the sleeping passengers) to Manaus in the middle of the Amazon, Brazil at 01:30. The reason given (eventually) was that the plane didn’t have permission to use Peruvian air space. We were sent to a local hotel which did not have rooms available and were abandoned there without a GOL representative. I ended up sharing a room (solo female) with a stranger (male) at 05:30 when it became free. We finally arrived in Quito at 18:30 the next day. I ended up missing my 10 day tour of the Galapagos and spending over USD350 on replacement flights. No response from GOL, nothing from customer service, no apology, no refund and no explanation/confirmation for me to give to my insurers.

Try to avoid this airline,Paula Silva,2019-01-30,GOL Linhas Aéreas,Trip Verified,"  Buenos Aires to Sao Paulo. A disaster no matter where you look at. I will never take a flight on this airline again. Delayed my first flight from bs as by 3 hrs, lost all my connecting flights. The worse part was the customer service at the airport. To find their counters, to having to visit 3 different offices to get answers. I think they must be losing so much money in all the hotel accommodation for passengers that miss their flights because of poor planning. One one agent was kind enough to show me my way to the right place in the airport.

Arrogant and rude personnel,Michel Perrin,2019-01-05,GOL Linhas Aéreas,Trip Verified," 
We flew GOL in a codeshare domestic Brazilian flight between Salvador and São Paulo, in order to there catch a TP flight to Lisbon. Unfortunately, GOL was not fit to manage codeshare pax: First of all check-in attendant was unable to understand that Japanese citizens do not need a Visa to enter Europe, as they are compelled to have a Visa to enter Brazil! Check-in took literally 40 minutes. Our luggage was tagged to Lisbon fortunately. However he did not recognize our Star Alliance Gold privileges despite codeshare number. We received both boarding passes SSA-GRU-LIS. We proceeded to security. When boarding we were forbidden to enter the aircraft, as ""we had been taken out of the flight"". Once more ground staff did not understand that we were on codeshare, and gave our seats to...GOL standby staff. We had to insist on boarding as we were on an international connection. Hard job. Arrogant and rude personnel. Our situation was responsible for a 20 min delay to the flight. Finally the 2 GOL employees accepted leaving the plane (they did not want to). We were not seated together. But after such a huge stress, it was not a serious point. It is obvious that GOL, an LCC, which has very limited international routes, and is not a member of Star Alliance, is not able to deal with TP pax.",Couple Leisure,January 2019,Salvador to Greater São Paulo,Business Class,3.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,2,no
Shady and unprofessional company,T Bilgeri,2018-10-06,GOL Linhas Aéreas,Trip Verified,"  Sao Paulo to Asuncion. My luggage was delayed by 6 days. The costumer service at the airport claimed that it would arrive with the next flight, which led us to stay in the city one day longer. However, this was untrue and wasted us a valuable day and the money for the hotel. The personnel responsible for the luggage promised to keep us up to date through email and phone calls but never contacted us. This led us to having to call them and to huge telephone fees due to being in a foreign country. After 6 days the luggage finally arrived but we were not contacted and only found out once we contacted them ourselves. The personnel at the airport claimed that we would get a reimbursement of 50 dollars for the first day and 25 dollars for every subsequent day of delay. I contacted the person responsible to get the money back but the communication was very difficult because they hardly answer your mails. At some point I got offered reimbursement of 50 dollars and was supposed to sign a document to never demand any more money of them. This is less then half of the money I was supposed to get according to their own airport personnel. After complaining about this fact I have never heard from them again. I still have not received any compensation for my losses.

This created a major issue where we needed to speak to the airline for hours and in the end he had to fly to another city to get a new passport so that we could continue with our travels. After speaking with them for months trying to resolve the issue and get reimbursed for this, they passed us around and honestly just played stupid to try to get us to give up.

Because of this I missed my flight to South Africa. The following day I checked with a doctor at Argentina's ministry of health who agreed my shot card was perfectly valid, legible, and the airline is wrong. I tried to file a complaint with the airline but they refuse to help, at first denied the incident ever took place, tried to cover it up by claiming I was a no-show, and are still claiming a handwritten numerical date is too difficult to read and refuse to refund me for their mistake.

GOL advertise the following benefits - Lounge Access, Extra checked luggage, Premium Check in, Premium Boarding, Extra Leg room seat, Amenity Kit, Premium class locker, Premium class toilet. Firstly, online check in did not work. It worked for the passenger travelling on the same booking but not for me. On arriving at GIG it was chaos. No priority check in could be found and GOL staff were rude and unhelpful. After 30 minute wait we reached check in. Our bags were processed and both were 24kg. The normal allowance is 21kg but increased to 32kg for premium passengers. We were given a slip and informed to take to payment desk to pay excess baggage charges. We explained we were not due any charges as we had a 32kg allowance, this took 30 minutes to sort out with lots of aggressive attitude towards us. Once through the check in ordeal we thought we would relax in the lounge. Wrong, on enquiring about location of the lounge we were laughed at by GOL staff and told no lounge, unlike the GOL advertised facilities. Boarding was meant to be by priority when in reality it was who could push hardest. Premium lockers were full of crew bags Premium toilets were used by anyone and everyone.

“Azul’s customer service is nonexistent”,Carla Rinaldi,2025-01-14,Azul Linhas Aéreas Brasileiras,Trip Verified,"   Never again! This is a classic sentence said by customers, and I really hope we will never need to buy tickets with Azul again. We tried to book a flight from Manaus to Rio de Janeiro, but the process was extremely complicated because we are not Brazilian and don’t have a CPF. It took forever, and we had to try multiple times. Eventually, we managed to book the tickets and received a confirmation email, so we assumed everything was fine. However, a few days later, we realized they had sent another email saying the payment was pending—for reasons unknown. No problem, we thought. Let’s try again. That’s when the real trouble began. We wanted to pay again using a card, but it wasn’t possible. They offered PIX as a payment option, but as foreigners, we don’t have access to PIX. What were we supposed to do? We tried to contact customer service. We called 5-6 different numbers, sent an email, and even messaged them on Facebook and Instagram. No response—until, finally, after 15 minutes on hold, someone picked up. The Azul representative told us the only way to fix the payment issue was to go to the Manaus airport in person, up to four hours before the flight. This was not a solution for us. We were on an organized tour in the Amazon and couldn’t just leave—and it’s 2024, so why couldn’t they send us a payment link to finalize the process? Still, the answer was no. Finally, a kind Brazilian offered to help us pay via PIX. We sent her the payment link, but it expired in just seven minutes. We sent another link, but after that, we weren’t given another chance to try. The result? We had to cancel a night and a day of our tour, lose money, and deal with immense frustration. Azul’s customer service is nonexistent. They don’t help, and they seem to actively make things difficult for foreigners by requiring CPF for booking and PIX for payment.

In addition, our return flight was rescheduled from 3:00 PM to 6:00 AM, with this being the only option offered, resulting in the loss of nearly a full day with family.

Landed in Recife, we ran to the gate, where very rude personnel told the first people arriving that they would board them soon. When they saw more people arriving, they didn't want to deal with that, and decide to lie again, saying they could not let us board because of the system. I am not even sure what they gained from all these lies. I think they were just not very brilliant and unable to understand what to do. it's just so frustrating to be denied boarding in front of your departing flight and on top to be treated so rudely.

The outbound flight was better than average and entirely acceptable. However, issues arose when the return flight got canceled by the airline. I had no opportunity for compensation regarding my accommodation or Uber expenses. The customer service team struggles with English proficiency, and when submitting required documents via email, the response is cold, stating that It is not acceptable. They don't provide a chance to resend documents or communicate through email; instead, you're directed to initiate a new claim.

The flight itself was fine,Simon Bourdin,2023-05-12,Azul Linhas Aéreas Brasileiras,Trip Verified,"  Azul's website is the most amateur circus show I have ever seen. I did not receive a confirmation e-mail upon buying my tickets. I could not find my reservations on the website either, and had to write the company on Facebook to confirm that they existed. To be fair, the Facebook staff was responsive and efficient -- why do they not assign these people to the actual website? There appear to be multiple redundant versions of the company's platform, in multiple languages, and I was kicked between these versions seemingly at random every time I clicked on anything. Online check-in was a three-hour-long living nightmare: the website as a whole seemed to stop working outright multiple times, every step of the procedure (when they happened at all) stalled my laptop for twenty to thirty seconds, and I had to redo the whole thing five or six times, before it actually went through at around one in the morning. As I write this review, I am attempting to check-in for my return flight, which I had the misfortune of taking with Azul as well: I have been trying for over two hours and it will not work. They apparently expect all passengers to have a valid Brazilian CPF (ID number), a phone number fitting in Brazilian standards, and other such information that only exists in Brazil. I am lucky to have lived in Brazil before, else I would have been entirely lost.  I tried buying extra luggage three times through two different versions of the site, one demanded that I have a valid CPF, and the other did not process my payment. Fast-forwarding to the luggage check-in at the airport in Paris, there was only one counter for Economy class.  Business class had four, if I recall. The flight itself was fine. Nothing worth writing home about one way or another. But when you are left more tired and stressed-out by online check-in, a process supposed to last five minutes, than by the subsequent nineteen-hour flight, that is a problem.

When we double checked, there was only one row left with two seats so we took them. We got a warning that we’d taken the seats to the emergency exit, but no hint that you couldn’t change the position of the back rest in that row. So we had to sit with a 90 degrees angle all flight long. It was a night flight and if we’d known we would’ve preferred not to sit together and be able to sleep instead. When we asked a stewardess for a pillow or blanket in the attempt to make it a little bit more comfortable for the back and neck, she just answered “one moment please” and simply never came back.

I was right behind them and didn’t listen anything. I was surprise when I saw the police taking the 2 guys, on a federal crime. I told another flight attendant that it was a mistake. They were drunk and loud but were never a threat. The fight attendant told me to shut up or I was going to be banish from aircraft, with the guys. I was very upset with his behavior and attitude but kept quiet. After all I had to arrive in Brazil asap.  We had to evacuate the plane for the bomb search. When we went back to lobby, I saw officers everywhere. I spoke with one of them and told my version of the facts!

Police did a search, just for precaution and left. When passengers were invited to board again, an employee from Azul called me and said I was not welcome to the plane. The captain decided he didn’t want me there.  I had to go to my mom’s funeral. My personal opinion should be a reason to turn me on a “persona non grata”. While in my knees, all the employees look to another side. No one look at me. I’m confused and revolted. Where is my right of free speech? I spoke with the police, for God sake! I just wanted to make my point, but the flight captain, on his arrogance, thought he had the right to change the course of my life, just because I cogitate the possibility that they were wrong!?!

I was charged 328€ for nothing,Leon Brückmann,2022-09-13,Azul Linhas Aéreas Brasileiras,Not Verified,"  I live in Germany. I have already tried to book flights via Azul airlines various times as I am a frequent traveller to Brazil. Unfortunately my experience with Azul Airlines never went further then trying to book a flight. It's mostly the payment or any other part of the internet service which does not work. Apparently it is not possible for a non Brazilian (or South American) citizen to book a flight -quite frankly I don't know what the problem is, however it is inacceptable. The first few times I tried to master this seemingly impossible task, the booking at least was simply canceled. The last time however, I was charged 328€ for nothing.

My baggage hasn’t arrived. What I can understand, problems happen. What I can’t understand is the way they are treating me. I called the number they gave me, not kidding 34 times from 8 am until 2 pm, nobody answered and when I called Azul they said they outsourced the baggage management and can’t do anything. After 5 days, if the problem is not solved, I should contact them. They may be kidding, they decide to outsource the business and it is my problem. In 5 days, I will be back in the US.

I was no longer able to use my credit,V Martos,2022-08-24,Azul Linhas Aéreas Brasileiras,Trip Verified,"  Azul is the most dishonest airline I have even dealt with, after purchasing tickets to travel in April of 2020, I was under the impression that I was granted credit for not being able to travel During the pandemic. No further communication was had, and by the time I was ready to book the flight I was told I had to travel within 6 months, but the border was still closed! By the time borders were open and vaccines were out I was no longer able to use my “credit” and they kept my $2,000 dollars. Their customer service is rude, no matter what language you choose to talk in. I am Fluent in Portuguese, English, and Spanish. So it is not a language barrier. Just a dishonest and rude company.

I would not recommend this company,P Ravela,2022-05-12,Azul Linhas Aéreas Brasileiras,Trip Verified,"  Azul Airlines used to be the best airline company of Brazil. Unfortunately, nothing lasts forever. The airplanes have been ""remodeled"", decreasing the space between rolls so that more seats could fit inside the airplane. Now even to get in your row is difficult. Business class is very expensive (we know the game: you pay more for more confort). So many seats have been squeezed in that you can barely turn on your own seat to sleep; moreover, there´s too many people for a few bathrooms; so bathroom lines are pretty usual during the flight. As I seat down, my seat was just filthy and had litter. It had not been cleaned I tried to sleep but the crew is so loud that you could hear the hitting of dishes, forks, knives, people bumping on your seat, load announcements for several times.  I would not recommend this company to anyone.",Couple Leisure,May 2022,Viracopos to Ft Lauderdale,Business Class,1.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,4,no

their policy is no refund,E Kanter,,Azul Linhas Aéreas Brasileiras,Trip Verified,"  Be careful, despite buying highest fare, their policy is no refund. We bought 3 tickets at the highest fare Mais Azul for 1200 reais. We cancelled the tickets before departure. Very complicated process. No possibility to complete it through their website. 40 minutes on the phone with their call center. At the end the employee informed: ""are you sure you want to cancel since this is a non refundable ticket"". However I told him that was full fare, other airlines are refunding at least a part of it. Nevertheless he answered that is not their policy, that is other airlines' policy. Great customer satisfaction skills! In the end no email regarding the cancellation process. I think they have to give us something like 90 reais back (they could at least give us back the airport taxes right?) however it can take up to 12 months (according to their call center).

I had an early morning flight from Bélem to Rio de Janeiro and due to a technical problem with the connecting bus I could not get to the airport on time. The help and understanding of the company was not only non-existent despite having the intermediate fare and having paid for two extra bags, but any action on their part implied the payment of extra fees for a higher amount than my old round trip (3000BRL), to relocate me on another flight is out of the question, it's not their problem, they have already charged.

The airplane was spotless, the space on the plane amazing, the food delicious but one main thing caught my attention, how polite and kind the flight attendants were. She helped me with my 2 year old and even gave me a blanket because of turbulence that ended up with us all soaked in soda.

customer service is non existent,J Shearer,2020-03-11,Azul Linhas Aéreas Brasileiras,Trip Verified,"  Sao Paulo to Fortaleza. The minor problem was an inconvenience, as the baggage check in kiosks failed to function properly, necessitating a queue to see an agent. The bigger problem was despite paying for two bags in advance Azul claimed I was only entitled to one. The purchase receipt could not be clearer that my allowance was two but the check in agent was obstinate despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary. This then required bringing in a supervisor who ultimately agreed with me and said the problem was at their end, where their internal system said one thing, my purchase receipt another. Hard to believe these people would fight me so hard despite their being so wrong. Basically they accused me of trying to steal from them, which couldn't be further from the truth. A final operational problem was IFE screens inoperable and could not connect to their WiFi, so it proved to be a long three hours. I won't be flying Azul again anytime soon as I have no confidence in their operations and their customer service is non existent.",Solo Leisure,March 2020,Lisbon to Sao Paulo,Economy Class,5.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,2,no
never set foot on an Azul Neo again,J Sears,2020-02-11,Azul Linhas Aéreas Brasileiras,Trip Verified,"  Lisbon to Sao Paulo. This is a tale of two aircraft in business class. Outbound on A330-200, inbound A330 Neo. I expected some differences between the experience on the different aircraft but was unprepared for what transpired. The A330-200 was comfortable, if perhaps a bit tired feeling. The A330 Neo felt new but was the worst business class experience in memory. The Neo cabin immediately felt claustrophobic upon entering. It felt as though they jammed in far too many seats in a small area. Then the seats themselves were extraordinarily uncomfortable and equally as claustrophobic. It led to this being a surprisingly poor experience.  When in recline mode, your legs disappear and slide under the IFE screen and other hardware of the shell. From mid thigh downward, you are trapped in a very narrow space which ends at about one foot high and less than one foot wide. It is impossible for your feet to rest without touching anything. It is impossible to roll over on your side and the height of your stacked knees and legs doesn't fit in the space.  Extraordinarily uncomfortable, in fact the most uncomfortable business class seat in memory. Was totally surprised that this happened on Azul, as I would expect much, much better of them. It's clear to me that they rolled out this product without soliciting opinions of actual travelers, and they are responsible for this mess. The crew confirmed I wasn't the first to mention this. I vowed never to do this again, as it was a complete waste of money. The rest of the experience was actually good - professional crews, punctual flights, ok food but for me the seat is by far the only thing that matters and Azul and Airbus are both guilty of jointly delivering a terrible product.

Think twice before booking,H Cassell,2019-11-30,Azul Linhas Aéreas Brasileiras,Trip Verified," Recife to Salvador. We booked Azul because of its good reputation but we’re shockingly disappointed in their service. The flight was delayed without explanation; however, the attendants allowed the passengers to stand in the breezeway and then sit on an extremely hot plane for an hour (as long as the flight should have been). We were only told that the reason the flight was delayed was due to being overweight because we asked an attendant. He explained that they would remove cargo so that we can have our flight. The Azul employees announced where to go for the baggage like normal. When we arrived in Salvador we waited at baggage claim for more than 30 minutes without explanation. Then only because we asked did an Azul employee explain that Azul did not lose baggage but rather decided to leave every single checked bag back in Recife without explanation, warning, or apology. We were then offered the option to sit in the airport for 3 hours to wait for our bags when we are only in Salvador for 2 days. The Azul staff were extremely unhelpful and would not replace medication or other necessities that were immediately needed. We spoke with a manager who did not give any appropriate reasoning for why the airline would choose to prioritize cargo over their own passengers who paid for their seats. She also refused to replace items that were immediately necessary and suggested that it could be more than a day before we get our bags (when again, we are only here for 2 days). Azul was extremely disrespectful to their international and local clients by making this decision and how they dealt with justifiably frustrated clients.

€0 compensation for 5 hour delay,Gary Waters,2019-05-15,Azul Linhas Aéreas Brasileiras,Trip Verified,"  
Sao Paulo to Lisbon. Received an email a few days before the flight informing me the flight would be 2 hours early. No problem. Went to check in , I got passed from pillar to post, nobody spoke English, nobody wanted responsibility. Eventually someone who had to speak to me said ”didn’t you receive the mail?” Why insult your passengers with complete lies, it was never sent. Basically the flight was delayed by 5 hours. Generously, they had re-scheduled my connection in Lisboa. The lounge at VCP is quite basic, very little choice on either food or drink, so being stuck in it for 7 hours was quite depressing. Luckily the net worked very well. Eventually I got on the plane. The food served in business class was very poor for an international flight. Beef in sauce, rice, potato sticks. I have a Brasilian wife, I know what the local food is like, this was poor. Then the selection of “fine” cheeses for dessert. What an insult. No taste, all soft cheeses, biscuits still in the wrapper. Then the bed - very thin and old padding, you could feel everything underneath you, being 1.87M tall I could not stretch and slept in a curl. Unfortunately there is a hard circular rim at the bottom of the foot well. Very uncomfortable. The FA’s service was very good during dinner, non existent at breakfast. I was not offered a cup of tea. Very poor for business. I have to be honest, I have my doubts over Azul’s viability in the international long haul market.

very pleased with economy,Paul Costello,2018-02-19,Azul Linhas Aéreas Brasileiras,Trip Verified," Travelled business class Lisbon to São Paulo/Campinas. We also had two economy flights between Sao Paulo and Rio. First São Paulo/Campinas is a huge ghost airport 100 plus kilometres from São Paulo so we had to wait more than an hour for next bus to capital which took another hour and 20 mins plus taxi to hotel so probably 3 hours to destination. On return we noticed only 3 international flights for the whole day. It makes no economic sense to use this airport as your hub. We were very pleased with economy flights, 40 euro each way and served a snack. Our issue is the lack of service on the 10 hour business class flights. The seat and design is good and matches all the products out there. It's the service, you get served a meal and then stewards disappear for the rest of the flight until breakfast a little over an hour before landing. This was a daytime flight crossing only two time zones. I shouldn't have to ask for a drink. I believe this policy needs to change. Also the meal itself was presented well but tasted like an economy meal and was lukewarm. It's presented all together so you have to eat starter quickly before your main goes cold.

Then I was notified by the airport that my flight was changed for the same date with a stay at the Viracopos airport for 12 hours. I complained to the airline and they could not do anything which I find inexplicable and today February 2 I receive another email where they want to change the ticket again and that have a stay from 9.35 am to 11.40 pm in Viracopos, about 14 hours of waiting which considered a mistreatment as a passenger and do not offer any compensation or explanation for the change.",Solo Leisure,July 2017,Brasilia to Belo Horizonte,Economy Class,4.0,2.0,3.0,0.0,3.0,7,no
do not consider using,Peter Meikle,,Azul Linhas Aéreas Brasileiras,Trip Verified,"  Brasilia to Belo Horizonte. I booked on the English website, they have sent an email in Portuguese. I think it says the original flight is cancelled offering a very late evening flight or BRL200 voucher to cancel. We are 2 elderly European non Portuguese speaking travellers who do not want to arrive late at night on New Years Eve in a strange city. Azul do not offer a reasonable alternative. Their website contact button does not work. A complaint is not answered. Azul are dreadful do not consider using.",Couple Leisure,December 2017,Brasilia to Belo Horizonte,Economy Class,2.0,5.0,5.0,0.0,1.0,1,no
I presume saying the flight is cancelled,Peter Meikle,2017-11-24,Azul Linhas Aéreas Brasileiras,Trip Verified,"  We have booked to fly with Azul next month from Brasilia to Belo Horizonte using their English language website paying in USD. They emailed me in Portuguese, I presume saying the flight is cancelled. I think they are saying we must accept a late evening flight or get 200 BRL voucher. I will not be booking any more flights in Brazil where I can use the voucher. I have booked all my flights in Brazil to arrive in new cities during daylight hours for personal security reasons. Azul have a flight at 09:35 which would be fine but they have not given that as an option.",Couple Leisure,November 2017,Curitiba to Sao Paulo Congonhas,Economy Class,3.0,5.0,4.0,0.0,1.0,1,no
a high standard,Donald Lindsay,2017-06-05,Azul Linhas Aéreas Brasileiras,," Just back from a short trip from Curitiba to Sao Paulo Congonhas and I really feel I must acknowledge the efforts of Azul Airlines that really goes the extra mile. While I find flying in Brazil to generally be of a high standard, what sets Azul apart is the sense of style, staff that really seem to get a kick out of their jobs and the impressively fast baggage claim. I'd travel more with this company if they flew more of the routes I travel on. Keep up the good work.",Business,June 2017,Rio de Janeiro to Lisbon via Viracopos,Economy Class,5.0,5.0,4.0,0.0,3.0,9,yes
customer service was useless,Paulo Viana,2017-03-05,Azul Linhas Aéreas Brasileiras,,"  Rio de Janeiro to Lisbon via Viracopos. Online booking magically booked a connecting flight departing earlier than my flight arrival. Luckly I managed to get it corrected before the fight date. Domestic leg from Rio de Janeiro SDU to Viracopos/Campinas was confortable with average service. Bagagge check was ok, no priority tags for business class with bags dispatched all the way to Lisbon. Onboard baggage allowance of one item up to 5 kilos was ridiculous. Boarding in Viracopos was confusing due to deficient signage. Business class full flat seats were very confortable, pillows were clean and smelled good. Meal service was average, no seconds offered even on water. Coffee only if requested but flight atendants vanished right after service was somewhat considered complete. More like economy business than full business. In flight entertainment was ok but could do with noise suppressing phones.  One checked suitcase did not arrive. Azul customer service was useless. Even after it arrived later on a TAP flight from Salvador, we were told in writing it was not their problem and that we should have a solution in the next 5 days.

it really surprised me,N Raeisa,2017-02-13,Azul Linhas Aéreas Brasileiras,,"  I always fly with Azul Airlines here in Brazil, but I decided to write about this specific flight due to the special circumstances. I was flying from Campinas to Floranópolis and when arriving at the destination, we were informed that there was a storm over Florianópolis. After spending some time over the surroundings expecting for a window to land, the pilot decided to abort the landing and continue to it's final destination which was Porto Alegre. Due to the impossibility to land in Florianópolis, and since it was night, Azul booked hotel rooms to the passengers, organized the transport, included meals and booked a return flight 6 am in the morning. Everything was well organized and well informed to avoid uncertainty between the passengers. I see the ability to deal with exceptions like this in a company way more important than superfluous in-flight meals or little threats. Not that Azul doesn't have it, but it really surprised me under such circumstance.",Solo Leisure,October 2016,Belo Horizonte to Salvador,Economy Class,4.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,10,yes
pay 120 Euros for small suitcase,C Takarini,2017-01-28,Azul Linhas Aéreas Brasileiras,,"  Belo Horizonte to Salvador. Their site has a problem accepting foreigners credit cards and their mobile site, when it works, doesn't have the bank payment option. When I couldn't book the ticket I send them a message asking for help and they responded days later. When I succeeded that they send me the code for the bank transfer they send the code in another persons name and I tried to contact them without receiving a fast response of what to do since there was an expiry day. When they responded I had already cancelled my previous ticket and bought a new one with the hope that the code of payment would be in my name. Thankfully it was, but when I arrived to the airport for a domestic flight, previous to an international one they told me I had to pay 120 Euros for a small suitcase of about 14kgs, since in domestic flights one cannot buy one more suitcase but has to buy excessive kilos.",Solo Leisure,January 2017,MOC to CNF,Economy Class,5.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,1,no
